<text>CHAPTER I (1)

IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

<quote connection="s32" id="s0" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s0,s1" id="s32" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">his lady</mention> to him one day, <quote connection="s32" id="s1" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

<quote connection="s33" id="s2" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;But it is,&quot;</quote> returned <mention connection="s2,s3" id="s33" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>; <quote connection="s33" id="s3" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s5,s7,s9,s11" id="s35" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet </mention>made no answer.

<quote connection="s34" id="s4" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Do not you want to know who has taken it?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s4,s6,s8,s10" id="s34" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">his wife</mention> impatiently.

<quote connection="s35" id="s5" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&quot;</quote>

This was invitation enough.

<quote connection="s34" id="s6" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s35" id="s7" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;What is his name?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s34" id="s8" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Bingley.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s35" id="s9" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Is he married or single?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s34" id="s10" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our girls!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s35" id="s11" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;How so?  how can it affect them?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s12" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dear <mention connection="s14,s16,s18,s20,s22" id="s36" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>,&quot;</quote> replied<mention connection="s12,s13,s15,s17,s19,s21,s23,s26,s28,s30" id="s37" speaker="Mrs_Bennet"> his wife</mention>, <quote connection="s37" id="s13" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;how can you be so tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s36" id="s14" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Is that his design in settling here?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s15" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Design!  nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s36" id="s16" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s17" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s36" id="s18" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s19" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s36" id="s20" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s21" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;But consider your daughters.  Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know they visit no new comers.  Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s36" id="s22" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s23" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.  But you are always giving _her_ the preference.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s38" id="s24" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;They have none of them much to recommend them,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s24,s25" id="s38" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>; <quote connection="s38" id="s25" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s26" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s27,s29,s31" id="s39" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, how can you abuse your own children in such way? You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion on my poor nerves.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s39" id="s27" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your nerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s28" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Ah!  you do not know what I suffer.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s39" id="s29" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s37" id="s30" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s39" id="s31" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them all.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.  _Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.  She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

__CHAPTER II (2)

MR. BENNET was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner.

Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, <mention connection="s40" id="s72" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention> suddenly addressed her with, <quote connection="s72" id="s40" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s73" id="s41" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s41,s42" id="s73" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention> resentfully, <quote connection="s73" id="s42" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;since we are not to visit.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s74" id="s43" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But you forget, <mention connection="s45" id="s75" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">mama</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s43,s44" id="s74" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s74" id="s44" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s75" id="s45" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two nieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s76" id="s46" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;No more have I,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s46,s47" id="s76" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>; <quote connection="s76" id="s47" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s48,s52" id="s77" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

<quote connection="s77" id="s48" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake!  Have a little compassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s78" id="s49" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s49,s50,s56" id="s78" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her father</mention>; <quote connection="s78" id="s50" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;she times them ill.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s79" id="s51" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;I do not cough for my own amusement,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s51" id="s79" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention> fretfully.

<quote connection="s77" id="s52" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;When is your next ball to be, <mention connection="s53" id="s80" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s80" id="s53" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;To-morrow fortnight.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s81" id="s54" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Aye, so it is,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s54,s55,s57" id="s81" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s81" id="s55" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s78" id="s56" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s81" id="s57" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Impossible, <mention connection="s58" id="s82" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s82" id="s58" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.  But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.&quot;</quote>

The girls stared at their father.  <mention connection="s59" id="s83" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> said only, <quote connection="s83" id="s59" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Nonsense, nonsense!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s84" id="s60" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s60,s61" id="s84" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>.  <quote connection="s84" id="s61" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you _there_.  What say you, Mary?  for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.&quot;</quote>

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

<quote connection="s85" id="s62" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;While Mary is adjusting her ideas,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s62,s63,s65" id="s85" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention> continued, <quote connection="s85" id="s63" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;let us return to Mr. Bingley.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s86" id="s64" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I am sick of Mr. Bingley,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s64" id="s86" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">his wife</mention>.

<quote connection="s85" id="s65" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?  If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.&quot;</quote>

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, <mention connection="s66" id="s87" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.

<quote connection="s87" id="s66" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I should persuade you at last.  I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am!  and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s88" id="s67" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s67" id="s88" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

<quote connection="s89" id="s68" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;What an excellent father you have, girls,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s68,s69" id="s89" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, when the door was shut.  <quote connection="s89" id="s69" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.  At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.  Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s90" id="s70" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s70,s71" id="s90" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention> stoutly, <quote connection="s90" id="s71" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest.&quot;</quote>

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.

__CHAPTER III (3)

NOT all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.  Her report was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted with him.  He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

<quote connection="s110" id="s91" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s91,s92" id="s110" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> to her husband, <quote connection="s110" id="s92" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.&quot;</quote>

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &amp;c.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.  She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.  Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved over such a large number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.  And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the oldest, and another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.  The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between him and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.  His character was decided.  He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.  Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it.

<quote connection="s111" id="s93" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Come, <mention connection="s95" id="s112" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s93,s94" id="s111" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention>, <quote connection="s111" id="s94" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I must have you dance.  I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had much better dance.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s112" id="s95" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s113" id="s96" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I would not be so fastidious as you are,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s96,s97,s99" id="s113" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s113" id="s97" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;for a kingdom!  Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly pretty.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s114" id="s98" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s98" id="s114" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

<quote connection="s113" id="s99" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Oh!  she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.  Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s115" id="s100" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Which do you mean?&quot;</quote> and turning round, <mention connection="s100,s101" id="s115" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, <quote connection="s115" id="s101" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bingley followed his advice.  Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.  Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They found Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.

<quote connection="s116" id="s102" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear Mr. Bennet,&quot;</quote> as <mention connection="s102,s103" id="s116" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> entered the room, <quote connection="s116" id="s103" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you had been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.  Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.  Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.  First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.  So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger --&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s117" id="s104" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;If he had had any compassion for _me_,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s104,s105" id="s117" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her husband</mention> impatiently, <quote connection="s117" id="s105" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;he would not have danced half so much!  For God's sake, say no more of his partners.  Oh!  that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s118" id="s106" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear,&quot;</quote> continued <mention connection="s106,s107" id="s118" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s118" id="s107" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I am quite delighted with him.  He is so excessively handsome!  and his sisters are charming women.  I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.  I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown --&quot;</quote>

Here she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

<quote connection="s119" id="s108" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;But I can assure you,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s108,s109" id="s119" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s119" id="s109" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome enough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.  I quite detest the man.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER IV (4)

WHEN Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.

<quote connection="s131" id="s120" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;He is just what a young man ought to be,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s120,s121,s124,s126,s128,s130" id="s131" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s131" id="s121" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! -- so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s132" id="s122" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He is also handsome,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s122,s123,s125" id="s132" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s132" id="s123" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby complete.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s131" id="s124" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.  I did not expect such a compliment.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s132" id="s125" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Did not you?  _I_ did for you.  But that is one great difference between us.  Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.  What could be more natural than his asking you again?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his gallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider person.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s131" id="s126" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Dear <mention connection="s127,s129" id="s133" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s133" id="s127" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.  You never see a fault in any body.  All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s131" id="s128" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s133" id="s129" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.  With _your_ good sense, to be honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough; -- one meets it every where.  But to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone.  And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?  Their manners are not equal to his.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s131" id="s130" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Certainly not; at first.  But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced.  Their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.  They were in fact very fine ladies, not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.  They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. -- Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.

His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.  Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.  He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. -- Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.  In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.  Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.

__CHAPTER V (5)

WITHIN a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King during his mayoralty.  The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.  For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.  By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. -- They had several children.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

<quote connection="s164" id="s134" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s134,s135,s137,s139,s142,s145,s148" id="s164" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> with civil self-command to <mention connection="s136,s138" id="s165" speaker="Charlotte">Miss Lucas</mention>.  <quote connection="s164" id="s135" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;You were Mr. Bingley's first choice.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s165" id="s136" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Yes; -- but he seemed to like his second better.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s164" id="s137" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh! -- you mean Jane, I suppose -- because he danced with her twice.  To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her -- indeed I rather believe he _did_ -- I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s165" id="s138" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?  and his answering immediately to the last question -- &quot;Oh!  the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot;&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s164" id="s139" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Upon my word! -- Well, that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if -- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s166" id="s140" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s140,s141" id="s166" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>.  <quote connection="s166" id="s141" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? -- Poor Eliza! -- to be only just _tolerable_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s164" id="s142" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s168" id="s143" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Are you quite sure, Ma'am? -- is not there a little mistake?&quot;</quote>  said <mention connection="s143,s144" id="s168" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>. -- <quote connection="s168" id="s144" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s164" id="s145" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; -- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s169" id="s146" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Miss Bingley told me,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s146,s147" id="s169" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s169" id="s147" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.  With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s164" id="s148" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s170" id="s149" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s149,s150" id="s170" speaker="Charlotte">Miss Lucas</mention>, <quote connection="s170" id="s150" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;but I wish he had danced with Eliza.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s171" id="s151" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Another time, <mention connection="s153" id="s172" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s151,s152" id="s171" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s171" id="s152" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I would not dance with _him_, if I were you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s172" id="s153" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s173" id="s154" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;His pride,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s154,s155" id="s173" speaker="Charlotte">Miss Lucas</mention>, <quote connection="s173" id="s155" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s174" id="s156" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is very true,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s156,s157" id="s174" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s174" id="s157" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s175" id="s158" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;Pride,&quot;</quote> observed <mention connection="s158,s159" id="s175" speaker="Mary_Bennet">Mary</mention>, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, <quote connection="s175" id="s159" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;is a very common failing I believe.  By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.  A person may be proud without being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s176" id="s160" speaker="a_young_male_Lucas">&quot;If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s160,s161" id="s176" speaker="a_young_male_Lucas">a young Lucas</mention> who came with his sisters, <quote connection="s176" id="s161" speaker="a_young_male_Lucas">&quot;I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s177" id="s162" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s162,s163" id="s177" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>; <quote connection="s177" id="s163" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.&quot;</quote>

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.

__CHAPTER VI (6)

THE ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form.  Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.  It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.

<quote connection="s228" id="s178" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;It may perhaps be pleasant,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s178,s179,s181,s183,s186" id="s228" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, <quote connection="s228" id="s179" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all _begin_ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.  In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.  Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s229" id="s180" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s228" id="s181" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Remember, <mention connection="s180,s182" id="s229" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Eliza</mention>, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s229" id="s182" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s228" id="s183" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.  When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s230" id="s184" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your plan is a good one,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s184,s185,s187,s190" id="s230" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s230" id="s185" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.  But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.  She has known him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.  This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s228" id="s186" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Not as you represent it.  Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s230" id="s187" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s231" id="s188" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Well,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s188,s189" id="s231" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, <quote connection="s231" id="s189" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always contrive to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s230" id="s190" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.&quot;</quote>

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; -- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.  <quote connection="s232" id="s191" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What does Mr. Darcy mean,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s191,s192,s194" id="s232" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> to <mention connection="s193" id="s233" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, <quote connection="s232" id="s192" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s233" id="s193" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s232" id="s194" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.&quot;</quote>

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, <mention connection="s195,s197" id="s234" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> turned to <mention connection="s196" id="s235" speaker="Mr_Darcy">him</mention> and said, <quote connection="s234" id="s195" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s235" id="s196" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;With great energy; -- but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s234" id="s197" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are severe on us.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s236" id="s198" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s198,s199" id="s236" speaker="Charlotte">Miss Lucas</mention>. <quote connection="s236" id="s199" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I am going to open the instrument, <mention connection="s200" id="s237" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Eliza</mention>, and you know what follows.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s237" id="s200" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! -- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body! -- If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.&quot;</quote>  On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, <mention connection="s201,s202" id="s238" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s238" id="s201" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Very well; if it must be so, it must.&quot;</quote>  And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, <quote connection="s238" id="s202" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with -- &quot;Keep your breath to cool your porridge,&quot; -- and I shall keep mine to swell my song.&quot;</quote>

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till <mention connection="s203" id="s239" speaker="Sir_William">Sir William</mention> thus began.

<quote connection="s239" id="s203" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;What a charming amusement for young people this is, <mention connection="s204" id="s240" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>! -- There is nothing like dancing after all. -- I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s240" id="s204" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Certainly, Sir; -- and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. -- Every savage can dance.&quot;</quote>

Sir William only smiled.  <quote connection="s242" id="s205" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;Your friend performs delightfully;&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s205,s206,s208,s210,s212,s213" id="s242" speaker="Sir_William">he</mention> continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; -- <quote connection="s242" id="s206" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, <mention connection="s245,s209,s211" id="s243" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s243" id="s245" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s242" id="s208" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.  Do you often dance at St. James's?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s243" id="s209" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Never, sir.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s242" id="s210" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s243" id="s211" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It is a compliment which I never pay to any place, if I can avoid it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s242" id="s212" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;You have a house in town, I conclude?&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy bowed.

<quote connection="s242" id="s213" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.&quot;</quote>

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, <mention connection="s214" id="s246" speaker="Sir_William">he</mention> was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, <quote connection="s246" id="s214" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? -- Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. -- You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.&quot;</quote>

And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when <mention connection="s215" id="s247" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William, <quote connection="s247" id="s215" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. -- I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor did <mention connection="s216,s218" id="s248" speaker="Sir_William">Sir William</mention> at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

<quote connection="s248" id="s216" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s249" id="s217" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Darcy is all politeness,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s217" id="s249" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, smiling.

<quote connection="s248" id="s218" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;He is indeed -- but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and <mention connection="s220,s222" id="s251" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by <mention connection="s219,s221" id="s250" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>.

<quote connection="s250" id="s219" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I can guess the subject of your reverie.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s251" id="s220" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I should imagine not.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s250" id="s221" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people! -- What would I give to hear your strictures on them!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s251" id="s222" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was more agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.

<mention connection="s223,s226" id="s252" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention> replied with great intrepidity, <quote connection="s252" id="s223" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Miss Elizabeth Bennet.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s253" id="s224" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Miss Elizabeth Bennet!&quot;</quote> repeated <mention connection="s224,s225,s227" id="s253" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>.  <quote connection="s253" id="s225" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I am all astonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite? -- and pray when am I to wish you joy?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s252" id="s226" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would be wishing me joy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s253" id="s227" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.  You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.&quot;</quote>

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.

__CHAPTER VII (7)

MR. BENNET'S property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner's shop just over the way.  The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.  Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.  Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.  Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.  They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,<mention connection="s254,s257,s259" id="s296" speaker="Mr_Bennet"> Mr. Bennet</mention> coolly observed, <quote connection="s296" id="s254" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.&quot;</quote>

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.

<quote connection="s297" id="s255" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I am astonished, my dear,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s255,s256,s258,s260" id="s297" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s297" id="s256" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own, however.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s296" id="s257" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s297" id="s258" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Yes -- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s296" id="s259" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s297" id="s260" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. -- When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.  I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s298" id="s261" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Mama,&quot;</quote> cried<mention connection="s261,s262" id="s298" speaker="Lydia_Bennet"> Lydia</mention>, <quote connection="s298" id="s262" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.

Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and <mention connection="s263" id="s299" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she </mention>was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, <quote connection="s299" id="s263" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well, Jane, who is it from?  what is it about?  what does he say?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s300" id="s264" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;It is from Miss Bingley,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s264" id="s300" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, and then read it aloud.

<quote connection="s302" id="s265" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;My dear Friend,

IF you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's te^te-a`-te^te between two women can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.  Yours ever,

<mention connection="s265" id="s302" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">CAROLINE BINGLEY.</mention>&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s301" id="s266" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;With the officers!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s266,s267" id="s301" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>.  <quote connection="s301" id="s267" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s303" id="s268" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Dining out,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s268,s269,s271,s274,s276" id="s303" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s303" id="s269" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;that is very unlucky.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s304" id="s270" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Can I have the carriage?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s270,s275" id="s304" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>.

<quote connection="s303" id="s271" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s305" id="s272" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That would be a good scheme,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s272,s273" id="s305" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s305" id="s273" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s303" id="s274" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s304" id="s275" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I had much rather go in the coach.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s303" id="s276" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, <mention connection="s277" id="s315" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, are not they?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s315" id="s277" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s306" id="s278" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But if you have got them to-day,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s278,s279" id="s306" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s306" id="s279" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;my mother's purpose will be answered.&quot;</quote>

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.  Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.

<quote connection="s307" id="s280" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s280" id="s307" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.

Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: <quote connection="" id="s281" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My dearest Lizzy,

I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.  My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore throat and head-ache, there is not much the matter with me.

Yours, &amp;c.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s308" id="s282" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Well, <mention connection="s284" id="s316" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">my dear</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s282,s283" id="s308" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, <quote connection="s308" id="s283" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s316" id="s284" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  I am not at all afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little trifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long is she stays there, it is all very well.  I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s287,s290" id="s311" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her resolution.

<quote connection="s309" id="s285" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;How can you be so silly,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s285,s286" id="s309" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s309" id="s286" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s311" id="s287" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s310" id="s288" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,&quot;</quote> said<mention connection="s288,s289" id="s310" speaker="Mr_Bennet"> her father</mention>, <quote connection="s310" id="s289" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;to send for the horses?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s311" id="s290" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, indeed.  I do not wish to avoid the walk.  The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back by dinner.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s312" id="s291" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;I admire the activity of your benevolence,&quot;</quote> observed <mention connection="s291,s292" id="s312" speaker="Mary_Bennet">Mary</mention>, <quote connection="s312" id="s292" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s313" id="s293" speaker="Catherine_and_Lydia">&quot;We will go as far as Meryton with you,&quot;</quote> said<mention connection="s293" id="s313" speaker="Catherine_and_Lydia"> Catherine and Lydia</mention>. -- Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.

<quote connection="s314" id="s294" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;If we make haste,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s294,s295" id="s314" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>, as they walked along, <quote connection="s314" id="s295" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.&quot;</quote>

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. -- That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. -- Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.

Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.  Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently attended her.

When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters, and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.  The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.

__CHAPTER VIII (8)

AT five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves, and then thought no more of the matter; and their indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.  She had very little notice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and <mention connection="s318" id="s417" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention> began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no stile, no taste, no beauty.

<mention connection="s317" id="s384" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">Mrs. Hurst</mention> thought the same, and added, <quote connection="s384" id="s317" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">&quot;She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this morning.  She really looked almost wild.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s417" id="s318" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;She did indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all!  Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s415" id="s319" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">&quot;Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s385" id="s320" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Your picture may be very exact, <mention connection="s319" id="s415" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">Louisa</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s320,s321" id="s385" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>; <quote connection="s385" id="s321" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;but this was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s386" id="s322" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;_You_ observed it, <mention connection="s324" id="s416" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>, I am sure,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s322,s323,s325" id="s386" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s386" id="s323" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ _sister_ make such an exhibition.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s416" id="s324" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Certainly not.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s386" id="s325" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  what could she mean by it?  It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s387" id="s326" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s326" id="s387" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>.

<quote connection="s388" id="s327" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,&quot;</quote> observed <mention connection="s327,s328,s332" id="s388" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention> in a half whisper, <quote connection="s388" id="s328" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s389" id="s329" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Not at all,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s330,s329" id="s389" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he </mention>replied; <quote connection="s389" id="s330" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;they were brightened by the exercise.&quot;</quote> -- A short pause followed this speech, and <mention connection="s331,s333" id="s391" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">Mrs. Hurst</mention> began again.

<quote connection="s391" id="s331" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">&quot;I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s388" id="s332" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s391" id="s333" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">&quot;Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s392" id="s334" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;That is capital,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s334" id="s392" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">her sister</mention>, and they both laughed heartily.

<quote connection="s393" id="s335" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s335,s336" id="s393" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s393" id="s336" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;it would not make them one jot less agreeable.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s394" id="s337" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s337" id="s394" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.  On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

<quote connection="s395" id="s338" speaker="Mr_Hurst">&quot;Do you prefer reading to cards?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s338,s339" id="s395" speaker="Mr_Hurst">he</mention>; <quote connection="s395" id="s339" speaker="Mr_Hurst">&quot;that is rather singular.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s396" id="s340" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Miss Eliza Bennet,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s340,s341" id="s396" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s396" id="s341" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;despises cards. She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s397" id="s342" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s342,s343" id="s397" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s397" id="s343" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s398" id="s344" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s344,s345" id="s398" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>; <quote connection="s398" id="s345" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.  <mention connection="s346" id="s399" speaker="Mr_Bingley">He </mention>immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.

<quote connection="s399" id="s346" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.

<quote connection="s400" id="s347" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I am astonished,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s347,s348,s351,s353,s355" id="s400" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s400" id="s348" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;that my father should have left so small a collection of books. -- What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, <mention connection="s349" id="s401" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s401" id="s349" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It ought to be good,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s350,s352" id="s402" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he </mention>replied, <quote connection="s402" id="s350" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;it has been the work of many generations.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s400" id="s351" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s402" id="s352" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s400" id="s353" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.  <mention connection="s354" id="s403" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Charles</mention>, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s403" id="s354" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I wish it may.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s400" id="s355" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s404" id="s356" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s405" id="s357" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I am talking of possibilities, <mention connection="s356,s358" id="s404" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Charles</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s404" id="s358" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Upon my word, <mention connection="s357" id="s405" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Caroline</mention>, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game.

<quote connection="s406" id="s359" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s359,s360,s362,s365" id="s406" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>; <quote connection="s406" id="s360" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;will she be as tall as I am?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s361" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s406" id="s362" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;How I long to see her again!  I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s407" id="s363" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;It is amazing to me,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s363,s364" id="s407" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s407" id="s364" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s406" id="s365" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;All young ladies accomplished!  My dear <mention connection="s366" id="s408" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Charles</mention>, what do you mean?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s408" id="s366" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Yes all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover skreens, and net purses.  I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s409" id="s367" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s367,s368,s372" id="s409" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s409" id="s368" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;has too much truth.  The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.  I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s410" id="s369" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Nor I, I am sure,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s369" id="s410" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>.

<quote connection="s411" id="s370" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Then,&quot;</quote> observed <mention connection="s370,s371,s377,s379" id="s411" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s411" id="s371" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished women.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s409" id="s372" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s419" id="s373" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Oh!  certainly,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s373,s374" id="s419" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">his faithful assistant</mention>, <quote connection="s419" id="s374" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s412" id="s375" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;All this she must possess,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s375,s376,s378" id="s412" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s412" id="s376" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s411" id="s377" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s412" id="s378" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s411" id="s379" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;_I_ never saw such a woman, _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.

<quote connection="s413" id="s380" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Eliza Bennet,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s380,s381" id="s413" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, when the door was closed on her, <quote connection="s413" id="s381" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own, and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s414" id="s382" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s382,s383" id="s414" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, <quote connection="s414" id="s383" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This she would not hear of, but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

__CHAPTER IX (9)

ELIZABETH passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.  The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her, that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.  She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

<quote connection="s483" id="s420" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Indeed I have, Sir,&quot;</quote> was <mention connection="s420,s421" id="s483" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her</mention> answer.  <quote connection="s483" id="s421" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;She is a great deal too ill to be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.  We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s465" id="s422" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Removed!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s422,s423" id="s465" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>.  <quote connection="s465" id="s423" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;It must not be thought of.  My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s466" id="s424" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;You may depend upon it, Madam,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s424,s425" id="s466" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, with cold civility, <quote connection="s466" id="s425" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

<quote connection="s484" id="s426" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I am sure,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s426,s427" id="s484" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s484" id="s427" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world -- which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.  I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s468" id="s428" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Whatever I do is done in a hurry,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s428,s429" id="s468" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention>; <quote connection="s468" id="s429" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s467" id="s430" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s430,s432" id="s467" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.

<quote connection="s469" id="s431" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;You begin to comprehend me, do you?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s431,s433" id="s469" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention>, turning towards her.

<quote connection="s467" id="s432" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  yes -- I understand you perfectly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s469" id="s433" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s487" id="s434" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is as it happens.  It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s470" id="s435" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s434,s439,s442" id="s487" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s435,s436" id="s470" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s470" id="s436" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s471" id="s437" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I did not know before,&quot;</quote> continued <mention connection="s437,s438" id="s471" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley </mention>immediately, <quote connection="s471" id="s438" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;that you were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s487" id="s439" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.  They have at least that advantage.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s472" id="s440" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;The country,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s440,s441" id="s472" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s472" id="s441" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s487" id="s442" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s473" id="s443" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s443,s444" id="s473" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.  <quote connection="s473" id="s444" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.&quot;</quote>

Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.  <mention connection="s445" id="s482" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.

<quote connection="s482" id="s445" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.  The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s481" id="s446" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;When I am in the country,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s446,s447" id="s481" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s481" id="s447" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s489" id="s448" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that gentleman,&quot;</quote> looking at Darcy, <quote connection="s489" id="s449" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;seemed to think the country was nothing at all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s474" id="s450" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s450,s451" id="s474" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, blushing for <mention connection="s448,s449,s452" id="s489" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>.  <quote connection="s474" id="s451" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s489" id="s452" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with four and twenty families.&quot;</quote>

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. <mention connection="s454" id="s490" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked <mention connection="s453,s455,s457" id="s485" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her</mention> if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

<quote connection="s485" id="s453" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley -- is not he?  so much the man of fashion!  so genteel and so easy! -- He has always something to say to every body. -- _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s490" id="s454" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Did Charlotte dine with you?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s485" id="s455" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.  But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity they are not handsome!  Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain -- but then she is our particular friend.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s477" id="s456" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;She seems a very pleasant young woman,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s456" id="s477" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>.

<quote connection="s485" id="s457" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  dear, yes; -- but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane -- one does not often see any body better looking.  It is what every body says.  I do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.  But however he did not.  Perhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s478" id="s458" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And so ended his affection,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s458,s459,s461" id="s478" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> impatiently. <quote connection="s478" id="s459" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s479" id="s460" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s460" id="s479" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>.

<quote connection="s478" id="s461" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Every thing nourishes what is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.&quot;</quote>

Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.  She performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. <mention connection="s462" id="s480" speaker="Mr_Bingley">His</mention> answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.

<quote connection="s480" id="s462" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement, and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please, name the very day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s463" id="s475" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention> declared herself satisfied.  <quote connection="s475" id="s463" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have given _your_ ball,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s464" id="s476" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s476" id="s464" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I shall insist on their giving one also.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine_ _eyes_.

__CHAPTER X (10)

THE day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room.  The loo table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between <mention connection="s493,s495,s497,s499,s502" id="s554" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> and his companion. The perpetual commendations of <mention connection="s491,s492,s494,s496,s498,s500,s501" id="s553" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">the lady</mention> either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

<quote connection="s553" id="s491" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!&quot;</quote>

He made no answer.

<quote connection="s553" id="s492" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;You write uncommonly fast.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s554" id="s493" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s553" id="s494" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year!  Letters of business too!  How odious I should think them!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s554" id="s495" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s553" id="s496" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s554" id="s497" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have already told her so once, by your desire.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s553" id="s498" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I mend pens remarkably well.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s554" id="s499" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Thank you -- but I always mend my own.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s553" id="s500" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;How can you contrive to write so even?&quot;</quote>

He was silent.

<quote connection="s553" id="s501" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s554" id="s502" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? -- At present I have not room to do them justice.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s503" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Oh!  it is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, <mention connection="s504,s508" id="s577" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s577" id="s504" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s556" id="s505" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s555" id="s506" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, <mention connection="s505" id="s556" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Caroline</mention>,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s506,s507,s511,s516" id="s555" speaker="Mr_Bingley">her brother</mention> -- <quote connection="s555" id="s507" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;because he does _not_ write with ease.  He studies too much for words of four syllables. -- Do not you, Darcy?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s577" id="s508" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;My stile of writing is very different from yours.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s557" id="s509" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Oh!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s509,s510" id="s557" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s557" id="s510" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s555" id="s511" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s558" id="s512" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your humility, Mr. Bingley,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s512,s513" id="s558" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s558" id="s513" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;must disarm reproof.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s559" id="s514" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Nothing is more deceitful,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s514,s515,s517,s520" id="s559" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s559" id="s515" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;than the appearance of humility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s555" id="s516" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s559" id="s517" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;The indirect boast; -- for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s560" id="s518" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Nay,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s518,s519" id="s560" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s560" id="s519" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.  At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s559" id="s520" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, &quot;Bingley, you had better stay till next week,&quot; you would probably do it, you would probably not go -- and, at another word, might stay a month.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s561" id="s521" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You have only proved by this,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s521,s522,s525" id="s561" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s561" id="s522" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s562" id="s523" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;I am exceedingly gratified,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s523,s524,s526" id="s562" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>, <quote connection="s562" id="s524" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s561" id="s525" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s562" id="s526" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter; <mention connection="s527" id="s564" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> must speak for himself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s564" id="s527" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, <mention connection="s528,s530" id="s563" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s563" id="s528" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;To yield readily -- easily -- to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s565" id="s529" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s563" id="s530" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You appear to me, <mention connection="s529,s531" id="s565" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s565" id="s531" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s566" id="s532" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;By all means,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s532,s533" id="s566" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>; <quote connection="s566" id="s533" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.  I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.  I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.

<quote connection="s567" id="s534" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I see your design, <mention connection="s536" id="s569" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Bingley</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s534,s535" id="s567" speaker="Mr_Darcy">his friend</mention>. -- <quote connection="s567" id="s535" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s569" id="s536" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s568" id="s537" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What you ask,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s537,s538" id="s568" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s568" id="s538" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange.  She could only imagine however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did not pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards <mention connection="s539,s542" id="s570" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her --

<quote connection="s570" id="s539" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?&quot;</quote>

She smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.

<quote connection="s571" id="s540" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s540,s541" id="s571" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s571" id="s541" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say &quot;Yes,&quot; that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.  I have therefore made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s570" id="s542" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Indeed I do not dare.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke <mention connection="s545,s547" id="s578" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

<quote connection="s572" id="s543" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I hope,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s543,s544,s546" id="s572" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention>, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, <quote connection="s572" id="s544" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. -- And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s578" id="s545" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s572" id="s546" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Oh!  yes. -- Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your great uncle, the judge.  They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s578" id="s547" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.&quot;</quote>

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.

<quote connection="s573" id="s548" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I did not know that you intended to walk,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s548" id="s573" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.

<quote connection="s574" id="s549" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">&quot;You used us abominably ill,&quot;</quote> answered <mention connection="s549,s550" id="s574" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">Mrs. Hurst</mention>, <quote connection="s574" id="s550" speaker="Louisa_Hurst">&quot;in running away without telling us that you were coming out.&quot;</quote> Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.

<mention connection="s551" id="s576" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention> felt their rudeness and immediately said, --

<quote connection="s576" id="s551" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go into the avenue.&quot;</quote>

But <mention connection="s552" id="s575" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, <quote connection="s575" id="s552" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, no; stay where you are. -- You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good bye.&quot;</quote>

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.

__CHAPTER XI (11)

WHEN the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and, seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation were considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.  Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.  He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; <mention connection="s579" id="s620" speaker="Mr_Hurst">Mr. Hurst</mention> also made her a slight bow, and said he was <mention connection="s620" id="s579" speaker="Mr_Hurst">&quot;very glad;&quot;</mention> but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.  Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.  She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, <mention connection="s580" id="s621" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> gave a great yawn and said, <quote connection="s621" id="s580" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.&quot;</quote>

No one made any reply.

She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, <mention connection="s581" id="s622" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> turned suddenly towards him and said, <quote connection="s622" id="s581" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? -- I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s624" id="s582" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;If you mean Darcy,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s582,s583,s586" id="s624" speaker="Mr_Bingley">her brother</mention>, <quote connection="s624" id="s583" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins -- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s625" id="s584" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I should like balls infinitely better,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s584,s585" id="s625" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> replied, <quote connection="s625" id="s585" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s624" id="s586" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; -- but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.

In the desperation of her feelings <mention connection="s587" id="s638" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> resolved on one effort more; and turning to Elizabeth, said, <quote connection="s638" id="s587" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. -- I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  <mention connection="s588" id="s641" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention> succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.  <quote connection="s641" id="s588" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;What could he mean?  she was dying to know what could be his meaning&quot;</quote> -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?

<quote connection="s639" id="s589" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Not at all,&quot;</quote> was <mention connection="s589,s590" id="s639" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her</mention> answer; <quote connection="s639" id="s590" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.

<quote connection="s627" id="s591" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s591,s592" id="s627" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, as soon as she allowed him to speak.  <quote connection="s627" id="s592" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; -- if the first, I should be completely in your way; -- and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s628" id="s593" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Oh!  shocking!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s593,s594,s597" id="s628" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>.  <quote connection="s628" id="s594" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I never heard any thing so abominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s629" id="s595" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s595,s596" id="s629" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s629" id="s596" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;We can all plague and punish one another.  Teaze him -- laugh at him. -- Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s628" id="s597" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;But upon my honour I do _not_.  I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.  Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!  No, no -- I feel he may defy us there.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s630" id="s598" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s598,s599" id="s630" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s630" id="s599" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.  I dearly love a laugh.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s631" id="s600" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Miss Bingley,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s600,s601,s604,s606" id="s631" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, <quote connection="s631" id="s601" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;has given me credit for more than can be.  The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s632" id="s602" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Certainly,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s602,s603,s605" id="s632" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> -- <quote connection="s632" id="s603" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.  I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. -- But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s631" id="s604" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Perhaps that is not possible for any one.  But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s632" id="s605" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Such as vanity and pride.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s631" id="s606" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s609" id="s640" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> turned away to hide a smile.

<quote connection="s633" id="s607" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s607,s608" id="s633" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>; -- <quote connection="s633" id="s608" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;and pray what is the result?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s640" id="s609" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s634" id="s610" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;No&quot;</quote> -- said <mention connection="s610,s611,s614" id="s634" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s634" id="s611" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have made no such pretension.  I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My temper I dare not vouch for. -- It is I believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be called resentful. -- My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s635" id="s612" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;_That_ is a failing indeed!&quot;</quote> -- cried <mention connection="s612,s613,s615" id="s635" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>. <quote connection="s635" id="s613" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your fault well. -- I really cannot _laugh_ at it; you are safe from me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s634" id="s614" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s635" id="s615" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s636" id="s616" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And yours,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s616,s617" id="s636" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> replied with a smile, <quote connection="s636" id="s617" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;is wilfully to misunderstand them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s637" id="s618" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Do let us have a little music,&quot;</quote> -- cried <mention connection="s618,s619" id="s637" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. -- <quote connection="s637" id="s619" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst.&quot;</quote>

Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.

__CHAPTER XII (12)

IN consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive hem with pleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added that, if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. -- Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day, to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence -- Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he liked -- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. -- Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. -- But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.

__CHAPTER XIII (13)

<quote connection="s671" id="s642" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I HOPE my dear,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s642,s643" id="s671" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention> to <mention connection="s644" id="s672" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">his wife</mention> as they were at breakfast the next morning, <quote connection="s671" id="s643" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s672" id="s644" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Who do you mean, <mention connection="s645" id="s686" speaker="Mr_Bennet">my dear</mention>?  I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe she often sees such at home.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s686" id="s645" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s646" id="s673" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet'</mention>s eyes sparkled. -- <quote connection="s673" id="s646" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure.  Why Jane -- you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. -- But -- good lord!  how unlucky!  there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell.  I must speak to Hill, this moment.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s674" id="s647" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s647,s648" id="s674" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her husband</mention>; <quote connection="s674" id="s648" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.&quot;</quote>

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, <mention connection="s649" id="s675" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention> thus explained.  <quote connection="s675" id="s649" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s676" id="s650" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s650,s651,s654" id="s676" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">his wife</mention>, <quote connection="s676" id="s651" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.&quot;</quote>

Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.  They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

<quote connection="s677" id="s652" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s652,s653,s655" id="s677" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s677" id="s653" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s676" id="s654" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such false friends.  Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s677" id="s655" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s678" id="s656" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

15th October.

DEAR SIR,

THE disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.&quot; -- &quot;There, Mrs. Bennet.&quot; -- &quot;My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.  As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.  I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends, -- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'nnight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.  I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

<mention connection="s656" id="s678" speaker="Mr_Collins">WILLIAM COLLINS</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s679" id="s657" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking gentleman,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s657,s658" id="s679" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, as he folded up the letter.  <quote connection="s679" id="s658" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s659" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s680" id="s660" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Though it is difficult,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s660,s661" id="s680" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s680" id="s661" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.

<quote connection="s681" id="s662" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He must be an oddity, I think,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s662,s663" id="s681" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>.  <quote connection="s681" id="s663" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I cannot make him out. -- There is something very pompous in his stile. -- And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? -- We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. -- Can he be a sensible man, <mention connection="s664" id="s687" speaker="Mr_Bennet">sir</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s687" id="s664" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;No, my dear; I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.  There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am impatient to see him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s682" id="s665" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;In point of composition,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s665,s666" id="s682" speaker="Mary_Bennet">Mary</mention>, <quote connection="s682" id="s666" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;his letter does not seem defective.  The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.&quot;</quote>

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet, indeed, said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.

This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but <mention connection="s667,s669" id="s683" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, <quote connection="s683" id="s667" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;You are very kind, <mention connection="s668" id="s684" speaker="Mr_Collins">sir</mention>, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s684" id="s668" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s683" id="s669" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Ah!  <mention connection="s670" id="s685" speaker="Mr_Collins">sir</mention>, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things, I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s685" id="s670" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, -- and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted --&quot;</quote>

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.  They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.  But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.

__CHAPTER XIV (14)

DURING dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.  She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself, -- some shelves in the closets up stairs.

<quote connection="s703" id="s688" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;That is all very proper and civil I am sure,&quot;</quote> said<mention connection="s688,s689,s691" id="s703" speaker="Mrs_Bennet"> Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s703" id="s689" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near you, <mention connection="s690,s692,s695,s700,s697" id="s704" speaker="Mr_Collins">sir</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s704" id="s690" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s703" id="s691" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I think you said she was a widow, sir?  has she any family?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s704" id="s692" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s705" id="s693" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Ah!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s693,s694,s696" id="s705" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, shaking her head, <quote connection="s705" id="s694" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;then she is better off than many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  is she handsome?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s704" id="s695" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;She is a most charming young lady indeed.  Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.  She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s705" id="s696" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Has she been presented?  I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s704" id="s697" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. -- These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s706" id="s698" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You judge very properly,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s698,s699" id="s706" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s706" id="s699" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s704" id="s700" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. -- Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. -- Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's _Sermons_.

Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, <mention connection="s701" id="s707" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she</mention> interrupted him with, <quote connection="s707" id="s701" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.&quot;</quote>

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but <mention connection="s702" id="s708" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, <quote connection="s708" id="s702" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.  It amazes me, I confess; -- for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer importune my young cousin.&quot;</quote>

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.

__CHAPTER XV (15)

MR. COLLINS was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.  This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them. -- Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's te^te-a`-te^te with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from <mention connection="s709" id="s711" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her</mention>, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. -- <quote connection="s711" id="s709" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; -- her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.

Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.  All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps.  This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty -- a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.  On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.  Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.  Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.  What could be the meaning of it? -- It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips' throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.

Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.  She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become <quote connection="" id="s710" speaker="NOTANUTTERANCE">&quot;stupid, disagreeable fellows.&quot;</quote>  Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.  The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins, on his return, highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips's manners and politeness.  He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.  Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.

__CHAPTER XVI (16)

AS no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantlepiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was over at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.  The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.

When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.

<quote connection="s797" id="s712" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I know little of the game, at present,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s712,s713" id="s797" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s797" id="s713" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life --&quot;</quote>  Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared not even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.  Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.  He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

<quote connection="s774" id="s714" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;About a month,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s714,s715" id="s774" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, <quote connection="s774" id="s715" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s775" id="s716" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Yes,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s716,s717,s718" id="s775" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention>; -- <quote connection="s775" id="s717" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

<quote connection="s775" id="s718" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. -- Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s776" id="s719" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;As much as I ever wish to be,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s719,s720,s723,s726,s729" id="s776" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> warmly, -- <quote connection="s776" id="s720" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s777" id="s721" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I have no right to give _my_ opinion,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s721,s722" id="s777" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention>, <quote connection="s777" id="s722" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;as to his being agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I have known him too long and to well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. -- Here you are in your own family.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s776" id="s723" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.  Every body is disgusted with his pride.  You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s778" id="s724" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I cannot pretend to be sorry,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s724,s725" id="s778" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention>, after a short interruption, <quote connection="s778" id="s725" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s776" id="s726" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.&quot;</quote>  Wickham only shook his head.

<quote connection="s779" id="s727" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I wonder,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s727,s728,s730" id="s779" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention>, at the next opportunity of speaking, <quote connection="s779" id="s728" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s776" id="s729" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s779" id="s730" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Oh!  no -- it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.  We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.

<quote connection="s780" id="s731" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s731,s732,s734,s737,s739" id="s780" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention> added, <quote connection="s780" id="s732" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is necessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.  I _must_ have employment and society.  A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.  The church _ought_ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s781" id="s733" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s780" id="s734" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.  He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s781" id="s735" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Good heavens!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s735,s736,s738,s733" id="s781" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s781" id="s736" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but how could _that_ be? -- How could his will be disregarded? -- Why did not you seek legal redress?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s780" id="s737" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s781" id="s738" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;This is quite shocking! -- He deserves to be publicly disgraced.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s780" id="s739" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Some time or other he _will_ be -- but it shall not be by _me_.  Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.

<quote connection="s782" id="s740" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But what,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s740,s741,s743" id="s782" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> after a pause, <quote connection="s782" id="s741" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;can have been his motive? -- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s742" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;A thorough, determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s782" id="s743" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!&quot;</quote>

After a few minutes reflection, however, <mention connection="s744" id="s783" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> continued, <quote connection="s783" id="s744" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.  His disposition must be dreadful.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s784" id="s745" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I will not trust myself on the subject,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s745,s746,s750" id="s784" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention>, <quote connection="s784" id="s746" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;_I_ can hardly be just to him.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s747" id="s785" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, <quote connection="s785" id="s747" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;To treat in such a manner, the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!&quot;</quote> -- <mention connection="s748" id="s786" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> could have added, <quote connection="s786" id="s748" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable&quot;</quote> -- but <mention connection="s749" id="s787" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> contented herself with <quote connection="s787" id="s749" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s784" id="s750" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.  _My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged.  himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s788" id="s751" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How strange!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s751,s752,s755,s757" id="s788" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s788" id="s752" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How abominable! -- I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! -- If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, -- for dishonesty I must call it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s789" id="s753" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;It _is_ wonderful,&quot;</quote> -- replied <mention connection="s753,s754,s756" id="s789" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention>, -- <quote connection="s789" id="s754" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; -- and pride has often been his best friend.  It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.  But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s788" id="s755" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s789" id="s756" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, -- to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.  Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.  Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.  He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s788" id="s757" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy,?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s758,s760,s762" id="s790" speaker="Mr_Wickham">He</mention> shook his head. -- <quote connection="s790" id="s758" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her brother, -- very, very proud. -- As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.  She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.  Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.&quot;</quote>

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, <mention connection="s759,s761" id="s791" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, <quote connection="s791" id="s759" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they suit each other? -- Do you know Mr. Bingley?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s790" id="s760" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Not at all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s791" id="s761" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s790" id="s762" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Probably not; -- but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses. He does not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, -- allowing something for fortune and figure.&quot;</quote>

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. -- The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.  It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.

<quote connection="s792" id="s763" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I know very well, madam,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s763,s764" id="s792" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s792" id="s764" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things, -- and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, <mention connection="s767,s769" id="s794" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention> asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

<quote connection="s793" id="s765" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Lady Catherine de Bourgh,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s765,s766,s768" id="s793" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> replied, <quote connection="s793" id="s766" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;has very lately given him a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s794" id="s767" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s793" id="s768" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, indeed, I did not. -- I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s794" id="s769" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.&quot;</quote>

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.

<quote connection="s795" id="s770" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Collins,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s770,s771" id="s795" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s795" id="s771" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s796" id="s772" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I believe her to be both in a great degree,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s772,s773" id="s796" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention>; <quote connection="s796" id="s773" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.  There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.  Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.  Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.

__CHAPTER XVII (17)

ELIZABETH related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and concern; -- she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. -- The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.

<quote connection="s809" id="s798" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;They have both,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s798,s799" id="s809" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s809" id="s799" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s811" id="s800" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Very true, indeed; -- and now, my dear <mention connection="s801,s803" id="s810" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? -- Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s810" id="s801" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.  My dearest <mention connection="s800,s802,s804" id="s811" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, -- one, whom his father had promised to provide for. -- It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.  Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?  oh!  no.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s811" id="s802" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. -- If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.  Besides, there was truth in his looks.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s810" id="s803" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;It is difficult indeed -- it is distressing. -- One does not know what to think.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s811" id="s804" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I beg your pardon; -- one knows exactly what to think.&quot;</quote>

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point, -- that Mr. Bingley, if he _had_ _been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card; Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attention of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy's looks and behaviour.  The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.

<quote connection="s812" id="s805" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;While I can have my mornings to myself,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s805,s806" id="s812" speaker="Mary_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s812" id="s806" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;it is enough. -- I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion that, though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and, if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.

<quote connection="s813" id="s807" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s807,s808" id="s813" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s813" id="s808" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, -- a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances: -- and to have Mr. Collins instead!  her liveliness had been never worse timed.  There was no help for it however.  Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.  She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. -- It now first struck her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.  Elizabeth, however, did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; -- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.

__CHAPTER XVIII (18)

TILL Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.

But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend <mention connection="s814" id="s923" speaker="Mr_Denny">Mr. Denny</mention>, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, <quote connection="s923" id="s814" speaker="Mr_Denny">&quot;I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.&quot;</quote>

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. -- Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was exstacy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.  When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; <mention connection="s815" id="s887" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention> tried to console <mention connection="s816" id="s888" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her</mention>.

<quote connection="s887" id="s815" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I dare say you will find him very agreeable.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s888" id="s816" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Heaven forbid! -- _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! -- To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! -- Do not wish me such an evil.&quot;</quote>

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.

After a pause of some minutes, <mention connection="s817,s818,s820" id="s889" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> addressed him a second time with: <quote connection="s889" id="s817" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. -- _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s819,s821" id="s890" speaker="Mr_Darcy">He</mention> smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.

<quote connection="s889" id="s818" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Very well. -- That reply will do for the present. -- Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. -- But _now_ we may be silent.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s890" id="s819" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s889" id="s820" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as as possible.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s890" id="s821" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s891" id="s822" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Both,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s822,s823,s826" id="s891" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> archly; <quote connection="s891" id="s823" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. -- We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s893" id="s824" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s824,s825" id="s893" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>.  <quote connection="s893" id="s825" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. -- _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s891" id="s826" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I must not decide on my own performance.&quot;</quote>

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.  <mention connection="s827" id="s894" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, <quote connection="s894" id="s827" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.&quot;</quote>

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.

At length <mention connection="s828" id="s895" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> spoke, and in a constrained manner said, <quote connection="s895" id="s828" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s896" id="s829" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s829,s830" id="s896" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> with emphasis, <quote connection="s896" id="s830" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.&quot;</quote>

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.  At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy <mention connection="s831" id="s897" speaker="Sir_William">he</mention> stopt with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.

<quote connection="s897" id="s831" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.  Such very superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you belong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley), shall take place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to Mr. Darcy: -- but let me not interrupt you, Sir. -- You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.&quot;</quote>

The latter part of this address was scarcely, heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.

Recovering himself, however, shortly, <mention connection="s832" id="s898" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> turned to <mention connection="s833,s835,s837" id="s924" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">his partner</mention>, and said, <quote connection="s898" id="s832" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s924" id="s833" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. -- We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s899" id="s834" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;What think you of books?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s834,s836" id="s899" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, smiling.

<quote connection="s924" id="s835" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Books -- Oh!  no. -- I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s899" id="s836" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. -- We may compare our different opinions.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s924" id="s837" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No -- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s900" id="s838" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it?&quot;</quote>  said <mention connection="s838" id="s900" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, with a look of doubt.

<quote connection="s901" id="s839" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, always,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s839,s840,s842,s844" id="s901" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,

<quote connection="s901" id="s840" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being_ _created_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s903" id="s841" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s841,s843,s845,s848" id="s903" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, with a firm voice.

<quote connection="s901" id="s842" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s903" id="s843" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I hope not.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s901" id="s844" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s903" id="s845" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;May I ask to what these questions tend?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s904" id="s846" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s846,s847" id="s904" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.  <quote connection="s904" id="s847" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am trying to make it out.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s903" id="s848" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And what is your success?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s849,s852" id="s905" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> shook her head.  <quote connection="s905" id="s849" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not get on at all.  I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s906" id="s850" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I can readily believe,&quot;</quote> answered <mention connection="s850,s851" id="s906" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> gravely, <quote connection="s906" id="s851" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s905" id="s852" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s907" id="s853" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s853" id="s907" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> coldly replied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.

They had not long separated when <mention connection="s854" id="s908" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention> came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, <quote connection="s908" id="s854" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! -- Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.  Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy, in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.  His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favorite's guilt; but really, considering his descent one could not expect much better.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s909" id="s855" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s855,s856" id="s909" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> angrily; <quote connection="s909" id="s856" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s910" id="s857" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s857,s858" id="s910" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention>, turning away with a sneer.  <quote connection="s910" id="s858" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Excuse my interference. -- It was kindly meant.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s911" id="s859" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Insolent girl!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s859,s860" id="s911" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> to herself. -- <quote connection="s911" id="s860" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.&quot;</quote>  She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.  Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. -- Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.

<quote connection="s912" id="s861" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I want to know,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s861,s862,s865,s867" id="s912" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, <quote connection="s912" id="s862" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.  But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s913" id="s863" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;No,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s863,s864,s866,s868" id="s913" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s913" id="s864" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s912" id="s865" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s913" id="s866" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s912" id="s867" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s913" id="s868" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s914" id="s869" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s869,s870" id="s914" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> warmly; <quote connection="s914" id="s870" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.  Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.&quot;</quote>

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told <mention connection="s873" id="s925" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her</mention> with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.

<quote connection="s915" id="s871" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I have found out,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s871,s872,s874" id="s915" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s915" id="s872" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How wonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! -- I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s925" id="s873" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s915" id="s874" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Indeed I am.  I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.  It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.

-- <mention connection="s875" id="s916" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention> listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, <quote connection="s916" id="s875" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.  You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.&quot;</quote>  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.  <mention connection="s876,s877,s878" id="s917" speaker="Mr_Collins">Her cousin</mention> prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words <quote connection="s917" id="s876" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;apology,&quot;</quote> <quote connection="s917" id="s877" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Hunsford,&quot;</quote> and <quote connection="s917" id="s878" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&quot;</quote> -- It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

<quote connection="s918" id="s879" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I have no reason, I assure you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s879,s880" id="s918" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s918" id="s880" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;to be dissatisfied with my reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome thought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.&quot;</quote>

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.  She saw her, in idea, settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.  Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. -- It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette, but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.  She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.  <mention connection="s881" id="s919" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Her mother</mention> only scolded her for being nonsensical.

<quote connection="s919" id="s881" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?  I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s926" id="s882" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. -- What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? -- You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.&quot;</quote>

Nothing that <mention connection="s882" id="s926" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> could say, however, had any influence.  Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.

At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, -- but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. -- Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.

<mention connection="s883" id="s920" speaker="Mr_Bennet">He</mention> took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, <quote connection="s920" id="s883" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;That will do extremely well, child.  You have delighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&quot;</quote>

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. -- Others of the party were now applied to.

<quote connection="s921" id="s884" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;If I,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s884,s885" id="s921" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>, <quote connection="s921" id="s885" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. -- I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. -- In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.  And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family.&quot;</quote>  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. -- Many stared. -- Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.  That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a project.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.  Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even <mention connection="s886" id="s922" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention> was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of <quote connection="s922" id="s886" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Lord how tired I am!&quot;</quote> accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.

__CHAPTER IV (27)

WITH no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.  Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.  Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.  As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and kindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.  Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.

<quote connection="s946" id="s927" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But, my dear <mention connection="s929,s931,s933,s935" id="s950" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s927,s928" id="s946" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s946" id="s928" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;what sort of girl is Miss King?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s950" id="s929" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Pray, <mention connection="s930,s932,s934,s936,s939,s941" id="s952" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">my dear aunt</mention>, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s952" id="s930" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s950" id="s931" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s952" id="s932" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s950" id="s933" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No -- why should he?  If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s952" id="s934" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s950" id="s935" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.  If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s952" id="s936" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.  It only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s947" id="s937" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Well,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s937,s938" id="s947" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s947" id="s938" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;have it as you choose.  _He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s952" id="s939" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.  I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s951" id="s940" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven!  I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s952" id="s941" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;Take care, <mention connection="s940" id="s951" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.&quot;</quote>

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

<quote connection="s948" id="s942" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s942,s943" id="s948" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>, <quote connection="s948" id="s943" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;but perhaps to the Lakes.&quot;</quote>

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.  <quote connection="s949" id="s944" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My dear, dear aunt,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s944,s945" id="s949" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> rapturously cried, <quote connection="s949" id="s945" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;what delight!  what felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to disappointment and spleen.  What are men to rocks and mountains?  Oh!  what hours of transport we shall spend!  And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.  We _will_ know where we have gone -- we _will_ recollect what we have seen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.  Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER V (28)

EVERY object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high-road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernable.  The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared that they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at a small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.  They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.  But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.  When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.  Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.  To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the excercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.  Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.

It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when <mention connection="s953,s956" id="s970" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention> joining in, observed, <quote connection="s970" id="s953" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.  We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.  Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.  I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s969" id="s954" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s954,s955" id="s969" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, <quote connection="s969" id="s955" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;and a most attentive neighbour.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s970" id="s956" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.&quot;</quote>

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all. About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.

She opened the door, and met <mention connection="s957" id="s966" speaker="Maria_Lucas">Maria</mention> in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, <quote connection="s966" id="s957" speaker="Maria_Lucas">&quot;Oh, my dear Eliza!  pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell you what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.

<quote connection="s968" id="s958" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And is this all?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s958,s959,s962" id="s968" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s968" id="s959" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s971" id="s960" speaker="Maria_Lucas">&quot;La!  my dear,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s960,s961,s963" id="s971" speaker="Maria_Lucas">Maria</mention> quite shocked at the mistake, <quote connection="s971" id="s961" speaker="Maria_Lucas">&quot;it is not Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.  The other is Miss De Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She is quite a little creature.  Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s968" id="s962" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.  Why does she not come in?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s971" id="s963" speaker="Maria_Lucas">&quot;Oh!  Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s967" id="s964" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I like her appearance,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s964,s965" id="s967" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, struck with other ideas.  <quote connection="s967" id="s965" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;She looks sickly and cross. -- Yes, she will do for him very well.  She will make him a very proper wife.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.

__CHAPTER VI (29)

MR. COLLINS'S triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.  The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

<quote connection="s1003" id="s972" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I confess,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s973,s972" id="s1003" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s1003" id="s973" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.  But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1004" id="s974" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;I am the less surprised at what has happened,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s975,s974" id="s1004" speaker="Sir_William">Sir William</mention>, <quote connection="s1004" id="s975" speaker="Sir_William">&quot;from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.  About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.&quot;</quote>

Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day, or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, <mention connection="s976" id="s1005" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention> said to Elizabeth, <quote connection="s1005" id="s976" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.  I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.&quot;</quote>

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. -- Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. -- Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. -- Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.  She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. -- Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. -- Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.  Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. -- He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not supply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.  Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? -- Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.

-- <mention connection="s977,s978,s980,s982,s984,s986,s988,s990,s991" id="s1006" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> then observed, <quote connection="s1006" id="s977" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,&quot;</quote> turning to Charlotte, <quote connection="s1006" id="s978" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. -- It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. -- Do you play and sing, <mention connection="s979,s981,s983,s985,s987,s989" id="s1010" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1010" id="s979" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;A little.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1006" id="s980" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Oh!  then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.  Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to -- You shall try it some day. -- Do your sisters play and sing?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1010" id="s981" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;One of them does.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1006" id="s982" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Why did not you all learn? -- You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's. -- Do you draw?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1010" id="s983" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, not at all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1006" id="s984" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;What, none of you?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1010" id="s985" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Not one.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1006" id="s986" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1010" id="s987" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1006" id="s988" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Has your governess left you?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1010" id="s989" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;We never had any governess.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1006" id="s990" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;No governess!  How was that possible?  Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! -- I never heard of such a thing.  Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s992,s994" id="s1009" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.

<quote connection="s1006" id="s991" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a governess you must have been neglected.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1009" id="s992" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.  We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.  Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1013" id="s993" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?  She finds Miss Pope a treasure.  &quot;Lady Catherine,&quot; said she, &quot;you have given me a treasure.&quot;  Are any of your younger sisters out, <mention connection="s994,s996" id="s1014" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1009,s1014" id="s994" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, <mention connection="s995,s993" id="s1013" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Ma'am</mention>, all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1013" id="s995" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;All! -- What, all five out at once?  Very odd! -- And you only the second. -- The younger ones out before the elder are married! -- Your younger sisters must be very young?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1014" id="s996" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.  But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. -- The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.  And to be kept back on such a motive! -- I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1007" id="s997" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Upon my word,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s997,s998" id="s1007" speaker="Lady_Catherine">her ladyship</mention>, <quote connection="s1007" id="s998" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. -- Pray, what is your age?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1008" id="s999" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;With three younger sisters grown up,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s999,s1000" id="s1008" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> smiling, <quote connection="s1008" id="s1000" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1001" id="s1011" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and <mention connection="s1002" id="s1012" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence!

<quote connection="s1011" id="s1001" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, -- therefore you need not conceal your age.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1012" id="s1002" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am not one and twenty.&quot;</quote>

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was superlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the other table, Lady Catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not say much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.  From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.  As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.

__CHAPTER VII (30)

SIR WILLIAM staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.  The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.  Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.  She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses' reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.  Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----; and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.

<mention connection="s1015" id="s1017" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte </mention>had seen them, from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, <quote connection="s1017" id="s1015" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.  Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.  Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.

<mention connection="s1016" id="s1018" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She </mention>answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added, <quote connection="s1018" id="s1016" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have you never happened to see her there?&quot;</quote>

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.

__CHAPTER VIII (31)

COLONEL Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing room.  Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself as well as of Mr. Darcy.

_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for <mention connection="s1019" id="s1049" speaker="Lady_Catherine">she</mention> did not scruple to call out, <quote connection="s1049" id="s1019" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are talking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear what it is.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1050" id="s1020" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;We are speaking of music, <mention connection="s1068" id="s1067" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Madam</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1020" id="s1050" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">he</mention>, when no longer able to avoid a reply.

<quote connection="s1067" id="s1068" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my delight.  I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.  I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.

<quote connection="s1052" id="s1022" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1022,s1023,s1026" id="s1052" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention>; <quote connection="s1052" id="s1023" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1053" id="s1024" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I assure you, Madam,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1024,s1025" id="s1053" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s1053" id="s1025" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;that she does not need such advice.  She practises very constantly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1052" id="s1026" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.  I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.  I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room.  She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.

<mention connection="s1027" id="s1054" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, <quote connection="s1054" id="s1027" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?  But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1055" id="s1028" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I shall not say that you are mistaken,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1028,s1029" id="s1055" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s1055" id="s1029" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1030,s1034,s1036" id="s1056" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, <quote connection="s1056" id="s1030" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1057" id="s1031" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am not afraid of you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1031" id="s1057" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, smilingly.

<quote connection="s1058" id="s1032" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1032,s1033" id="s1058" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">Colonel Fitzwilliam</mention>.  <quote connection="s1058" id="s1033" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1056" id="s1034" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball -- and at this ball, what do you think he did?  He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you -- but so it was.  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  <mention connection="s1035" id="s1059" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>, you cannot deny the fact.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1059" id="s1035" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1056" id="s1036" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your orders.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1060" id="s1037" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Perhaps,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1037,s1038" id="s1060" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s1060" id="s1038" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1061" id="s1039" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1039,s1040" id="s1061" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  <quote connection="s1061" id="s1040" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1062" id="s1041" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;I can answer your question,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1041,s1042" id="s1062" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">Fitzwilliam</mention>, <quote connection="s1062" id="s1042" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;without applying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the trouble.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1063" id="s1043" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1043,s1044" id="s1063" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s1063" id="s1044" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.  I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1064" id="s1045" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My fingers,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1045,s1046" id="s1064" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1064" id="s1046" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.  They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising.  It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1047" id="s1065" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> smiled, and said, <quote connection="s1065" id="s1047" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You are perfectly right.  You have employed your time much better.  No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.  We neither of us perform to strangers.&quot;</quote>

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.

<mention connection="s1048" id="s1066" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy, <quote connection="s1066" id="s1048" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.

__CHAPTER IX (32)

ELIZABETH was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.

They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.

It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, <mention connection="s1069" id="s1091" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> observed, <quote connection="s1091" id="s1069" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, <mention connection="s1070,s1072" id="s1092" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention>!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1092" id="s1070" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Perfectly so -- I thank you.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1071,s1073" id="s1093" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She </mention>found that she was to receive no other answer -- and, after a short pause, added, <quote connection="s1093" id="s1071" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1092" id="s1072" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.  He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1093" id="s1073" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.  But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1094" id="s1074" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I should not be surprised,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1074,s1075" id="s1094" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s1094" id="s1075" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth made no answer.  <mention connection="s1077,s1079,s1081" id="s1096" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.

<mention connection="s1076,s1078,s1080,s1082,s1085" id="s1095" speaker="Mr_Darcy">He</mention> took the hint, and soon began with, <quote connection="s1095" id="s1076" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;This seems a very comfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1096" id="s1077" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1095" id="s1078" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1096" id="s1079" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1095" id="s1080" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1096" id="s1081" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;An easy distance do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1095" id="s1082" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a day's journey.  Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1097" id="s1083" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1083,s1084" id="s1097" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s1097" id="s1084" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1095" id="s1085" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.  Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.&quot;</quote>

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as <mention connection="s1086" id="s1098" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> answered, <quote connection="s1098" id="s1086" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.  But that is not the case _here_.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1087" id="s1099" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention> drew his chair a little towards her, and said, <quote connection="s1099" id="s1087" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth looked surprised.

The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; <mention connection="s1088" id="s1100" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, <quote connection="s1100" id="s1088" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Are you pleased with Kent?&quot;</quote>

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.  The te^te-a`-te^te surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.

<quote connection="s1101" id="s1089" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;What can be the meaning of this!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1089,s1090" id="s1101" speaker="Charlotte">Charlotte</mention>, as soon as he was gone.  <quote connection="s1101" id="s1090" speaker="Charlotte">&quot;My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.&quot;</quote>

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were over.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.  They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.  He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out. -- She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

__CHAPTER X (33)

MORE than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. -- She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. -- How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! -- Yet it did, and even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.  His words seemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.

Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, <mention connection="s1102,s1105" id="s1147" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> said, <quote connection="s1147" id="s1102" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I did not know before that you ever walked this way.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1148" id="s1103" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;I have been making the tour of the Park,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1103,s1104,s1107" id="s1148" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s1148" id="s1104" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.  Are you going much farther?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1147" id="s1105" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, I should have turned in a moment.&quot;</quote>

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.

<quote connection="s1149" id="s1106" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1106,s1108,s1111,s1113" id="s1149" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>.

<quote connection="s1148" id="s1107" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his disposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1149" id="s1108" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.  I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1150" id="s1109" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;He likes to have his own way very well,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1109,s1110,s1112,s1114" id="s1150" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">Colonel Fitzwilliam</mention>.  <quote connection="s1150" id="s1110" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;But so we all do.  It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1149" id="s1111" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.  Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1150" id="s1112" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;These are home questions -- and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1149" id="s1113" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1150" id="s1114" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1151" id="s1115" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Is this,&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1115,s1116" id="s1151" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1151" id="s1116" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;meant for me?&quot;</quote> and <mention connection="s1117" id="s1152" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, <quote connection="s1152" id="s1117" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?  Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.&quot;</quote>

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.

To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, <mention connection="s1118,s1121" id="s1153" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> soon afterwards said, <quote connection="s1153" id="s1118" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.  I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1154" id="s1119" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;No,&quot;</quote> said<mention connection="s1119,s1120,s1123,s1126,s1128,s1130,s1132" id="s1154" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam"> Colonel Fitzwilliam</mention>, <quote connection="s1154" id="s1120" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;that is an advantage which he must divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1153" id="s1121" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Are you, indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you make?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.&quot;</quote>

As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.

<mention connection="s1122" id="s1155" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> directly replied, <quote connection="s1155" id="s1122" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.  She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard you say that you know them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1154" id="s1123" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man -- he is a great friend of Darcy's.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1156" id="s1124" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  yes,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1124,s1125,s1127,s1129,s1131,s1133" id="s1156" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> drily -- <quote connection="s1156" id="s1125" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1154" id="s1126" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;Care of him! -- Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.  From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.  It was all conjecture.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1156" id="s1127" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What is it you mean?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1154" id="s1128" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;It is a circumstance which Darcy, of course, would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1156" id="s1129" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You may depend upon my not mentioning it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1154" id="s1130" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.  What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1156" id="s1131" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1154" id="s1132" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1156" id="s1133" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And what arts did he use to separate them?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1157" id="s1134" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;He did not talk to me of his own arts,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1134,s1135,s1138" id="s1157" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">Fitzwilliam</mention> smiling.  <quote connection="s1157" id="s1135" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;He only told me what I have now told you.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.

<quote connection="s1158" id="s1136" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am thinking of what you have been telling me,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1136,s1137" id="s1158" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>. <quote connection="s1158" id="s1137" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he to be the judge?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1157" id="s1138" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1159" id="s1139" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.&quot;</quote>  <quote connection="s1159" id="s1140" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1139,s1140,s1141" id="s1159" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> continued, recollecting herself, <quote connection="s1159" id="s1141" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1160" id="s1142" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;That is not an unnatural surmise,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1142,s1143" id="s1160" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">Fitzwilliam</mention>, <quote connection="s1160" id="s1143" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.&quot;</quote>

This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.

<quote connection="s1161" id="s1144" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">&quot;There were some very strong objections against the lady,&quot;</quote> were <mention connection="s1144" id="s1161" speaker="Colonel_Fitzwilliam">Colonel Fitzwilliam</mention>'s words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.

<quote connection="s1162" id="s1145" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;To Jane herself,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1145,s1146" id="s1162" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> exclaimed, <quote connection="s1162" id="s1146" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;there could be no possibility of objection.  All loveliness and goodness as she is!  Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.  Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.&quot;</quote>  When she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.

__CHAPTER XI (34)

WHEN they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.  Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.  Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.

After a silence of several minutes, <mention connection="s1163" id="s1186" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, <quote connection="s1186" id="s1163" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;In vain have I struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be repressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed.  He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.  His sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.

Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and <mention connection="s1164" id="s1187" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> said, <quote connection="s1187" id="s1164" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.  But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.

At length, in a voice of forced calmness, <mention connection="s1165" id="s1188" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> said, <quote connection="s1188" id="s1165" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of small importance.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1189" id="s1166" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I might as well enquire,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1166,s1167" id="s1189" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1189" id="s1167" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;why, with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I have.  Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?&quot;</quote>

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while <mention connection="s1168" id="s1190" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> continued.

<quote connection="s1190" id="s1168" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.  You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.&quot;</quote>

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

<quote connection="s1191" id="s1169" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Can you deny that you have done it?&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1169" id="s1191" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> repeated.

With assumed tranquillity <mention connection="s1170" id="s1192" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> then replied, <quote connection="s1192" id="s1170" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate, her.

<quote connection="s1193" id="s1171" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But it is not merely this affair,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1171,s1172,s1174" id="s1193" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> continued, <quote connection="s1193" id="s1172" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;on which my dislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this subject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1194" id="s1173" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1173" id="s1194" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

<quote connection="s1193" id="s1174" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1195" id="s1175" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;His misfortunes!&quot;</quote> repeated <mention connection="s1175,s1176" id="s1195" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> contemptuously; <quote connection="s1195" id="s1176" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1196" id="s1177" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And of your infliction,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1177,s1178" id="s1196" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> with energy.  <quote connection="s1196" id="s1178" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.  You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1197" id="s1179" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And this,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1179,s1180" id="s1197" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, as he walked with quick steps across the room, <quote connection="s1197" id="s1180" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in which you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But perhaps,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1181" id="s1198" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, <quote connection="s1198" id="s1181" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination -- by reason, by reflection, by every thing.  But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.  They were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when <mention connection="s1182" id="s1199" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> said, <quote connection="s1199" id="s1182" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.&quot;</quote>

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and <mention connection="s1183" id="s1200" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> continued, <quote connection="s1200" id="s1183" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.&quot;</quote>

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  <mention connection="s1184" id="s1201" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> went on.

<quote connection="s1201" id="s1184" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1202" id="s1185" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.&quot;</quote>

And with these words <mention connection="s1185" id="s1202" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.  She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  that he should have been in love with her for so many months!  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.

She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.

__CHAPTER XII (35)

ELIZABETH awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road.  The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.  She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.  <mention connection="s1203" id="s1205" speaker="Mr_Darcy">He</mention> had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, <quote connection="s1205" id="s1203" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?&quot;</quote> -- And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. -- The envelope itself was likewise full. -- Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows: --

<quote connection="s1206" id="s1204" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.  You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.

Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister; -- and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. -- Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. -- But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. -- If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry. -- The necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd. -- I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country. -- But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. -- I had often seen him in love before. -- At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.  From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also watched. -- Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. -- If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error.  Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. -- If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. -- That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain, -- but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. -- I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; -- I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. -- My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. -- But there were other causes of repugnance; -- causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. -- These causes must be stated, though briefly. -- The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly, betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. -- Pardon me. -- It pains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. -- I will only say farther that, from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. -- He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. --

The part which I acted is now to be explained. -- His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. -- We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice. -- I described, and enforced them earnestly. -- But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.  He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard. -- But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. -- To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. -- I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.  I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. -- That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; -- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. -- Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. -- It is done, however, and it was done for the best. -- On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them. --

With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has _particularly_ accused me, I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.  Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; -- most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.  My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The vicious propensities -- the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. It adds even another motive.  My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and, if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.  The business was therefore soon settled.  He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.  You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.  After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.  How he lived I know not.  But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.  I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would have been complete indeed.

This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not, perhaps, to be wondered at.  Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.  But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you.

__CHAPTER XIII (36)

IF Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and stedfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.  His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all pride and insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. <mention connection="s1207" id="s1210" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, <quote connection="s1210" id="s1207" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;This must be false!  This cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!&quot;</quote> -- and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving, in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success.  On both sides it was only assertion.  Again she read on.  But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.  But no such recollection befriended her.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.  But, alas!  the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.  She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy -- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.  His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.  Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance -- an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways -- seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.  That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.  That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. -- Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.

<quote connection="s1211" id="s1208" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How despicably have I acted!&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1208,s1209" id="s1211" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> cried. -- <quote connection="s1211" id="s1209" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I, who have prided myself on my discernment! -- I, who have valued myself on my abilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust. -- How humiliating is this discovery! -- Yet, how just a humiliation! -- Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.  But vanity, not love, has been my folly. -- Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.  Till this moment, I never knew myself.&quot;</quote>

From herself to Jane -- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. -- How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? -- He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; -- and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.  -- Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. -- She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.  The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family; -- and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. -- Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.  She could think only of her letter.

__CHAPTER XIV (37)

THE two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.  <quote connection="s1225" id="s1212" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What would she have said? -- how would she have behaved?&quot;</quote> were questions with which <mention connection="s1212" id="s1225" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. -- <quote connection="s1226" id="s1213" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1213,s1214" id="s1226" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention>; <quote connection="s1226" id="s1214" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me! -- They were excessively sorry to go!  But so they always are.  The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.  His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, <mention connection="s1215,s1218,s1220" id="s1227" speaker="Lady_Catherine">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1227" id="s1215" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1228" id="s1216" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1216,s1217,s1219,s1221,s1223" id="s1228" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1228" id="s1217" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but it is not in my power to accept it. -- I must be in town next Saturday.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1227" id="s1218" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.  Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1228" id="s1219" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But my father cannot. -- He wrote last week to hurry my return.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1227" id="s1220" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Oh!  your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. -- Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1228" id="s1221" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1222,s1224" id="s1229" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> seemed resigned.

<quote connection="s1229" id="s1222" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.  It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. -- Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her. -- Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. -- I am excessively attentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1228" id="s1223" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My uncle is to send a servant for us.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1229" id="s1224" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Oh! -- Your uncle! -- He keeps a man-servant, does he? -- I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses? -- Oh!  Bromley, of course. -- If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.&quot;</quote>

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her, or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.  Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.

Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.  She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.  When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of remedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.  While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.

Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.

__CHAPTER XV (38)

ON Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

<quote connection="s1241" id="s1230" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I know not, Miss Elizabeth,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1230,s1231" id="s1241" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention>, <quote connection="s1241" id="s1231" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.  The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.

<mention connection="s1232,s1233" id="s1242" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention> was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, <quote connection="s1242" id="s1232" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.&quot;</quote>

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.

<quote connection="s1242" id="s1233" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself, at least, that you will be able to do so.  Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate --; but on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.  There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed for each other.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.  Poor Charlotte! -- it was melancholy to leave her to such society! -- But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.  Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

<quote connection="s1243" id="s1234" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;But,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1234,s1235" id="s1243" speaker="Mr_Collins">he</mention> added, <quote connection="s1243" id="s1235" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth made no objection; -- the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.

<quote connection="s1244" id="s1236" speaker="maria">&quot;Good gracious!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1236,s1237,s1239" id="s1244" speaker="maria">Maria</mention>, after a few minutes silence, <quote connection="s1244" id="s1237" speaker="maria">&quot;it seems but a day or two since we first came! -- and yet how many things have happened!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1245" id="s1238" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;A great many indeed,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1238" id="s1245" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her companion</mention> with a sigh.

<quote connection="s1244" id="s1239" speaker="maria">&quot;We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! -- How much I shall have to tell!&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1240" id="s1246" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> privately added, <quote connection="s1246" id="s1240" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And how much I shall have to conceal.&quot;</quote>

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister farther.

__CHAPTER XVI (39)

IT was the second week in May in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room upstairs.  These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters,<mention connection="s1247" id="s1270" speaker="Kitty_and_Lydia"> they</mention> triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, <quote connection="s1270" id="s1247" speaker="Kitty_and_Lydia">&quot;Is not this nice?  is not this an agreeable surprise?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1271" id="s1248" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;And we mean to treat you all,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1248,s1249,s1250" id="s1271" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>; <quote connection="s1271" id="s1249" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.&quot;</quote>  Then shewing her purchases: <quote connection="s1271" id="s1250" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Look here, I have bought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.&quot;</quote>

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, <mention connection="s1251,s1253" id="s1272" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she</mention> added, with perfect unconcern, <quote connection="s1272" id="s1251" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1273" id="s1252" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Are they indeed?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1252" id="s1273" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, with the greatest satisfaction.

<quote connection="s1272" id="s1253" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.  Mamma would like to go too, of all things!  Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1274" id="s1254" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes,&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1254,s1255" id="s1274" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1274" id="s1255" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1275" id="s1256" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Now I have got some news for you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1256,s1257" id="s1275" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>, as they sat down to table.  <quote connection="s1275" id="s1257" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;What do you think?  It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like.&quot;</quote>

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.  <mention connection="s1258,s1261,s1263" id="s1276" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention> laughed, and said, <quote connection="s1276" id="s1258" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is an ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long chin in my life.  Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?  There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.  There's for you!  She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.  Wickham is safe.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1277" id="s1259" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And Mary King is safe!&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1259,s1260" id="s1277" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1277" id="s1260" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1276" id="s1261" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1278" id="s1262" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1262" id="s1278" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>.

<quote connection="s1276" id="s1263" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I am sure there is not on _his_.  I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.  Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

<quote connection="s1279" id="s1264" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;How nicely we are crammed in!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1264,s1265" id="s1279" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>.  <quote connection="s1279" id="s1265" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.  She is almost three and twenty!  Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty!  My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.  Lord!  how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.  Dear me!  we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Foster's.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!); and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, -- only think what fun!  Not a soul knew of it but Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I laughed!  and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died.  And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.&quot;</quote>

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

Their reception at home was most kind.

Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did <mention connection="s1266" id="s1280" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention> say voluntarily to Elizabeth, <quote connection="s1280" id="s1266" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.&quot;</quote>

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them.  Lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.

<quote connection="s1281" id="s1267" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  Mary,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1267,s1268" id="s1281" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1281" id="s1268" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!  as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought we never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of laughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!&quot;</quote>

To this, <mention connection="s1269" id="s1282" speaker="Mary_Bennet">Mary</mention> very gravely replied, <quote connection="s1282" id="s1269" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.  They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me.  I should infinitely prefer a book.&quot;</quote>

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason too, for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.  In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

__CHAPTER XVII (40)

ELIZABETH'S impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

<quote connection="s1319" id="s1283" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1283,s1284,s1287,s1289" id="s1319" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>; <quote connection="s1319" id="s1284" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1320" id="s1285" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1285,s1286,s1288,s1290" id="s1320" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1320" id="s1286" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1319" id="s1287" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Blame you!  Oh, no.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1320" id="s1288" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1319" id="s1289" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1320" id="s1290" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day.&quot;</quote>

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was this for poor Jane!  who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.  Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one without involving the other.

<quote connection="s1321" id="s1291" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;This will not do,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1291,s1292" id="s1321" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s1321" id="s1292" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.  Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse.&quot;</quote>

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

<quote connection="s1322" id="s1293" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I do not know when I have been more shocked,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1293,s1294,s1296,s1298,s1300,s1302" id="s1322" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>. <quote connection="s1322" id="s1294" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr. Darcy!  dear <mention connection="s1295,s1297,s1299" id="s1323" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, only consider what he must have suffered.  Such a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!  and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is really too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1323" id="s1295" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1322" id="s1296" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!  such an openness and gentleness in his manner.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1323" id="s1297" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.  One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1322" id="s1298" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1323" id="s1299" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.  One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1322" id="s1300" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s1301,s1303,s1305" id="s1324" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention> when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1324" id="s1301" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough.  I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.  And with no one to speak to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh!  how I wanted you!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1322" id="s1302" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1324" id="s1303" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1304,s1306" id="s1325" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention> paused a little and then replied, <quote connection="s1325" id="s1304" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your own opinion?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1324" id="s1305" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.  On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.  Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.  Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1325" id="s1306" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.  He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him desperate.&quot;</quote>

The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.  She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.  <quote connection="s1326" id="s1307" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And then,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1307,s1308" id="s1326" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1326" id="s1308" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!&quot;</quote>

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.  Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.

<quote connection="s1327" id="s1309" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well, <mention connection="s1311" id="s1329" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1309,s1310,s1312" id="s1327" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> one day, <quote connection="s1327" id="s1310" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?  For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my sister Philips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body, too, who is likely to know.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1329" id="s1311" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1327" id="s1312" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh, well!  it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.  Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done.&quot;</quote>

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.

<quote connection="s1328" id="s1313" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well, <mention connection="s1315,s1317" id="s1330" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>,&quot;</quote> continued <mention connection="s1313,s1314,s1316,s1318" id="s1328" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention> soon afterwards, <quote connection="s1328" id="s1314" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only hope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1330" id="s1315" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, nothing at all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1328" id="s1316" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes. _They_ will take care not to outrun their income.  _They_ will never be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.  They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1330" id="s1317" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It was a subject which they could not mention before me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1328" id="s1318" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;No.  It would have been strange if they had.  But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.  _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER XVIII (41)

THE first week of their return was soon gone.  The second began.  It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.  Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.

<quote connection="s1363" id="s1331" speaker="Kitty_and_Lydia">&quot;Good Heaven!  What is to become of us!  What are we to do!&quot;</quote> would <mention connection="s1331,s1332" id="s1363" speaker="Kitty_and_Lydia">they</mention> often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.  <quote connection="s1363" id="s1332" speaker="Kitty_and_Lydia">&quot;How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?&quot;</quote>

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.

<quote connection="s1364" id="s1333" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I am sure,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1333,s1334" id="s1364" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1364" id="s1334" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.  I thought I should have broke my heart.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1365" id="s1335" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;I am sure I shall break _mine_,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1335,s1337" id="s1365" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>.

<quote connection="s1366" id="s1336" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;If one could but go to Brighton!&quot;</quote> observed <mention connection="s1336,s1338" id="s1366" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>.

<quote connection="s1365" id="s1337" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh, yes! -- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so disagreeable.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1366" id="s1338" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1367" id="s1339" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1339" id="s1367" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention>.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

<quote connection="s1368" id="s1340" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1340,s1341" id="s1368" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1368" id="s1341" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.&quot;</quote>

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.

<mention connection="s1342" id="s1369" speaker="Mr_Bennet">He</mention> heard her attentively, and then said, <quote connection="s1369" id="s1342" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1370" id="s1343" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If you were aware,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1343,s1344" id="s1370" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1370" id="s1344" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1371" id="s1345" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Already arisen!&quot;</quote> repeated <mention connection="s1345,s1346" id="s1371" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>.  <quote connection="s1371" id="s1346" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little <mention connection="s1347" id="s1372" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>!  But do not be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1372" id="s1347" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent, It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.  Excuse me -- for I must speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.  A flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.  In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.  She will follow wherever Lydia leads. -- Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!  Oh!  my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1348" id="s1373" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention> saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, <quote connection="s1373" id="s1348" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.  Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say, three -- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.  At Brighton she will be of less importance, even as a common flirt, than she has been here.  The officers will find women better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.&quot;</quote>

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.  She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.

Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?  They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.  Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that, however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked <mention connection="s1350,s1352,s1354" id="s1375" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her</mention> how she had liked him.  Her answer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference <mention connection="s1349,s1351,s1353" id="s1374" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention> soon afterwards added, <quote connection="s1374" id="s1349" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;How long did you say that he was at Rosings?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1375" id="s1350" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Nearly three weeks.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1374" id="s1351" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;And you saw him frequently?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1375" id="s1352" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, almost every day.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1374" id="s1353" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;His manners are very different from his cousin's.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1375" id="s1354" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1376" id="s1355" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Indeed!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1355" id="s1376" speaker="Mr_Wickham">Wickham</mention> with a look which did not escape her. <quote connection="s1377" id="s1356" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;And pray may I ask -- ?&quot;</quote> but checking himself, <mention connection="s1356,s1357" id="s1377" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention> added in a gayer tone, <quote connection="s1377" id="s1357" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Is it in address that he improves?  Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?  for I dare not hope,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1358" id="s1378" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention> continued in a lower and more serious tone, <quote connection="s1378" id="s1358" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;that he is improved in essentials.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1379" id="s1359" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, no!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1359,s1360" id="s1379" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s1379" id="s1360" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.&quot;</quote>

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.

There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while <mention connection="s1361" id="s1380" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1380" id="s1361" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.&quot;</quote>

Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, <mention connection="s1362" id="s1381" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he</mention> turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents, <quote connection="s1381" id="s1362" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.  His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.  The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

__CHAPTER XIX (42)

HAD Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had, very early in their marriage, put an end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort, for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.  He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she found what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

<quote connection="s1390" id="s1382" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But it is fortunate,&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1382,s1383" id="s1390" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1390" id="s1383" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that I have something to wish for.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.  But here, by my carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.  A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.&quot;</quote>

When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.  Those to her mother contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the camp; -- and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.  Everything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War-Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.  In that county, there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.  But it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.  <quote connection="s1391" id="s1384" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But surely,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1384,s1385" id="s1391" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1391" id="s1385" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.&quot;</quote>

The period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.  But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.  One enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &amp;c. are sufficiently known.  A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

<quote connection="s1392" id="s1386" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1386,s1387" id="s1392" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">her aunt</mention>.  <quote connection="s1392" id="s1387" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.  Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.  She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  <quote connection="s1393" id="s1388" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1388,s1389" id="s1393" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1393" id="s1389" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the finest woods in the country.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.  A most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.

To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

VOLUME IIICHAPTER I (43)

ELIZABETH, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road, with some abruptness, wound.  It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; -- and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.  Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth was delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene -- the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it -- with delight.  As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

<quote connection="s1456" id="s1394" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And of this place,&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1394,s1395,s1396" id="s1456" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1456" id="s1395" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I might have been mistress!  With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!  Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. -- But no,&quot;</quote> -- recollecting herself, -- <quote connection="s1456" id="s1396" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them.&quot;</quote>  This was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret.

She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.  At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while <mention connection="s1397" id="s1457" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">Mrs. Reynolds</mention> replied that he was, adding, <quote connection="s1457" id="s1397" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;but we expect him tomorrow, with a large party of friends.&quot;</quote>  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantlepiece.  Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence. -- <quote connection="s1458" id="s1398" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;He is now gone into the army,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1398,s1399" id="s1458" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1458" id="s1399" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.

<quote connection="s1459" id="s1400" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;And that,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1400,s1401" id="s1459" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">Mrs. Reynolds</mention>, pointing to another of the miniatures, <quote connection="s1459" id="s1401" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;is my master -- and very like him.  It was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1460" id="s1402" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;I have heard much of your master's fine person,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1402,s1403" id="s1460" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>, looking at the picture; <quote connection="s1460" id="s1403" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1404,s1406,s1408" id="s1461" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">Mrs. Reynolds</mention>'s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.

<quote connection="s1461" id="s1404" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1405" id="s1462" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> coloured, and said -- <quote connection="s1462" id="s1405" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;A little.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1461" id="s1406" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, <mention connection="s1407" id="s1463" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Ma'am</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1463" id="s1407" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, very handsome.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1461" id="s1408" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond of them.&quot;</quote>

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

<mention connection="s1410" id="s1465" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">Mrs. Reynolds</mention> then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.

<quote connection="s1464" id="s1409" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1409" id="s1464" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">Mr. Gardiner</mention>.

<quote connection="s1465" id="s1410" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Oh!  yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! -- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1411,s1415" id="s1466" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">Mr. Gardiner</mention>, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; <mention connection="s1412,s1416" id="s1467" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">Mrs. Reynolds</mention>, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.

<quote connection="s1466" id="s1411" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1467" id="s1412" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1468" id="s1413" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Except,&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1413,s1414" id="s1468" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1468" id="s1414" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;when she goes to Ramsgate.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1466" id="s1415" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;If your master would marry, you might see more of him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1467" id="s1416" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.  I do not know who is good enough for him.&quot;</quote>

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  <mention connection="s1417" id="s1469" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> could not help saying, <quote connection="s1469" id="s1417" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1470" id="s1418" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1418" id="s1470" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">the other</mention>.  Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as <mention connection="s1419,s1421,s1424" id="s1471" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">the housekeeper</mention> added, <quote connection="s1471" id="s1419" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.&quot;</quote>

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion.

Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to <mention connection="s1420" id="s1472" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">her uncle</mention> for saying, <quote connection="s1472" id="s1420" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You are lucky in having such a master.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1471" id="s1421" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Yes, Sir, I know I am.  If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.  But I have always observed that they who are good-natured when children are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth almost stared at her. -- <quote connection="s1473" id="s1422" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Can this be Mr. Darcy!&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1422" id="s1473" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>.

<quote connection="s1474" id="s1423" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;His father was an excellent man,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1423" id="s1474" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>.

<quote connection="s1471" id="s1424" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point.  She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.  Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

<quote connection="s1475" id="s1425" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;He is the best landlord, and the best master,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1425,s1426" id="s1475" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1475" id="s1426" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;that ever lived.  Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.  Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.  To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1476" id="s1427" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;In what an amiable light does this place him!&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1427,s1430" id="s1476" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.

<quote connection="s1477" id="s1428" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;This fine account of him,&quot;</quote> whispered <mention connection="s1428,s1429,s1431" id="s1477" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">her aunt</mention>, as they walked, <quote connection="s1477" id="s1429" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1476" id="s1430" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Perhaps we might be deceived.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1477" id="s1431" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;That is not very likely; our authority was too good.&quot;</quote>

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.

<quote connection="s1478" id="s1432" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He is certainly a good brother,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1432" id="s1478" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, as she walked towards one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight when she should enter the room.  <quote connection="s1479" id="s1433" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;And this is always the way with him,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1433,s1434" id="s1479" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">she</mention> added. -- <quote connection="s1479" id="s1434" speaker="Mrs_Reynolds">&quot;Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for her.&quot;</quote>

The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shewn.  In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.  At last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.  She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's life time.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.  What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! -- How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! -- How much of good or evil must be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.  Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.

At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was overpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!  Oh!  why did she come?  or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly altered, -- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her was amazing! -- but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!  She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was.  She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.  With a triumphant smile, they were told that it was ten miles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.  Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.  Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.  The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.  For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.  This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.  With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but <mention connection="s1435,s1436" id="s1480" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> had not got beyond the words <quote connection="s1480" id="s1435" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;delightful,&quot;</quote> and <quote connection="s1480" id="s1436" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;charming,&quot;</quote> when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.  <quote connection="s1481" id="s1437" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What will be his surprise,&quot;</quote> thought <mention connection="s1437,s1438" id="s1481" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1481" id="s1438" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;when he knows who they are!  He takes them now for people of fashion.&quot;</quote>

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.  That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was <mention connection="s1439" id="s1482" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> repeating, <quote connection="s1482" id="s1439" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Why is he so altered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.  My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It is impossible that he should still love me.&quot;</quote>

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.  It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short silence, <mention connection="s1440" id="s1484" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">the lady</mention> first spoke.  She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected -- <quote connection="s1484" id="s1440" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;for your housekeeper,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1441" id="s1483" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1483" id="s1441" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.&quot;</quote>  He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.  <quote connection="s1485" id="s1442" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;They will join me early tomorrow,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1442,s1443" id="s1485" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> continued, <quote connection="s1485" id="s1443" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, -- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.

<quote connection="s1486" id="s1444" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;There is also one other person in the party,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1444,s1445" id="s1486" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> continued after a pause, <quote connection="s1486" id="s1445" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;who more particularly wishes to be known to you, -- Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?&quot;</quote>

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.  They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the te^te-a`-te^te was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.  <quote connection="s1487" id="s1446" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1446,s1449" id="s1487" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">her uncle</mention>.

<quote connection="s1488" id="s1447" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;There is something a little stately in him to be sure,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1447,s1448" id="s1488" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">her aunt</mention>, <quote connection="s1488" id="s1448" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1487" id="s1449" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1489" id="s1450" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;To be sure, Lizzy,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1450,s1451" id="s1489" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">her aunt</mention>, <quote connection="s1489" id="s1451" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.

<quote connection="s1490" id="s1452" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1452,s1453" id="s1490" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">her uncle</mention>.  <quote connection="s1490" id="s1453" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.

<quote connection="s1491" id="s1454" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;From what we have seen of him,&quot;</quote> continued <mention connection="s1454,s1455" id="s1491" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>, <quote connection="s1491" id="s1455" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.  He has not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.  But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character!  I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else.  Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.

__CHAPTER II (44)

ELIZABETH had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.  They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.  She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.  All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again.  He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.  The suspicions which had just arisen, of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.  Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.  But though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.  No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.  <mention connection="s1492" id="s1494" speaker="Mr_Bingley">He</mention> observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it <quote connection="s1494" id="s1492" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her --&quot;</quote> and, before she could reply, <mention connection="s1493" id="s1495" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention> added, <quote connection="s1495" id="s1493" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.  There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and manner which gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.

Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Miss Bennet to dinner at Pemberley before they left the country.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.  They could not be untouched by his politeness, and, had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit.  It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting Derbyshire he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not hate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called.  The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude. -- Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.  She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him; she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley -- for she had reached it only to a late breakfast -- ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. -- Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.

__CHAPTER III (45)

CONVINCED as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.  Its windows, opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.  Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were employing her.  She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.  After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.  She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.  There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; -- a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.

<mention connection="s1496" id="s1504" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">Miss Bingley</mention> saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, <quote connection="s1504" id="s1496" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?  They must be a great loss to _your_ family.&quot;</quote>

In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.  Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana would not join her.  Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.  When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

<quote connection="s1505" id="s1497" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1497,s1498" id="s1505" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> cried; <quote connection="s1505" id="s1498" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.&quot;</quote>

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned -- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.

<quote connection="s1506" id="s1499" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;For my own part,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1499,s1500" id="s1506" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> rejoined, <quote connection="s1506" id="s1500" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.  Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable.&quot;</quote>

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.

He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak <mention connection="s1501" id="s1507" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">she</mention> continued, <quote connection="s1507" id="s1501" speaker="Caroline_Bingley">&quot;I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, &quot;_She_ a beauty! -- I should as soon call her mother a wit.&quot;  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1508" id="s1502" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Yes,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1502,s1503" id="s1508" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, who could contain himself no longer, <quote connection="s1508" id="s1503" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.&quot;</quote>

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.  The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.

__CHAPTER IV (46)

ELIZABETH had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.  Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as <mention connection="s1509,s1510" id="s1534" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.

It was to this effect: <quote connection="s1534" id="s1509" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! -- Imagine our surprise.  To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I am very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! -- But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly grieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.  Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.&quot;</quote>

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows -- it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first: <quote connection="s1534" id="s1510" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.  Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.  All that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the London road.  I know not what to think.  After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success; no such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.  Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing? -- Impossible.  I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.  Adieu.  I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.  In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1535" id="s1511" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  where, where is my uncle?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1511" id="s1535" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, <mention connection="s1512" id="s1536" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, <quote connection="s1536" id="s1512" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not a moment to lose.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1537" id="s1513" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Good God!  what is the matter?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1513,s1514" id="s1537" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, <quote connection="s1537" id="s1514" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.  You are not well enough; -- you cannot go yourself.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.  Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.

On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for <mention connection="s1515" id="s1538" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, <quote connection="s1538" id="s1515" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Let me call your maid.  Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief? -- A glass of wine; -- shall I get you one? -- You are very ill.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1539" id="s1516" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No, I thank you;&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1516,s1517" id="s1539" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> replied, endeavouring to recover herself.  <quote connection="s1539" id="s1517" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well.  I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.&quot;</quote>

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.  At length, <mention connection="s1518" id="s1540" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> spoke again.  <quote connection="s1540" id="s1518" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.  It cannot be concealed from any one.  My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped; -- has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from Brighton.  _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever.&quot;</quote>

Darcy was fixed in astonishment.  <quote connection="s1541" id="s1519" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;When I consider,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1519,s1520,s1523,s1525,s1526" id="s1541" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> added, in a yet more agitated voice, <quote connection="s1541" id="s1520" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that _I_ might have prevented it! -- _I_ who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt -- to my own family!  Had his character been known, this could not have happened.  But it is all, all too late now.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1542" id="s1521" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am grieved, indeed,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1521,s1522,s1524" id="s1542" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>; <quote connection="s1542" id="s1522" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;grieved -- shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1541" id="s1523" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh yes! -- They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1542" id="s1524" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1541" id="s1525" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.  But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?  How are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!&quot;</quote>

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

<quote connection="s1541" id="s1526" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character. -- Oh!  had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do!  But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched, mistake!&quot;</quote>

Darcy made no answer.  He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.  She should neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia -- the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all -- soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, <mention connection="s1528" id="s1544" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of <mention connection="s1527" id="s1543" speaker="Mr_Darcy">her companion</mention>, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, <quote connection="s1543" id="s1527" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.  Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress! -- But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1544" id="s1528" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible. -- I know it cannot be long.&quot;</quote>

He readily assured her of his secrecy -- again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.  But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.  Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.  No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.  While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise -- all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural.  For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.  Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. -- Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.

She was wild to be at home -- to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.  Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; -- but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy. -- Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.  Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power. -- <mention connection="s1531" id="s1546" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  <quote connection="s1545" id="s1529" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But what is to be done about Pemberley?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1529,s1530" id="s1545" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>.  <quote connection="s1545" id="s1530" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; -- was it so?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1546" id="s1531" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.  _That_ is all settled.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1547" id="s1532" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;That is all settled!&quot;</quote> repeated <mention connection="s1532,s1533" id="s1547" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">the other</mention>, as she ran into her room to prepare.  <quote connection="s1547" id="s1533" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth!  Oh, that I knew how it was!&quot;</quote>

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.

__CHAPTER V (47)

<quote connection="s1618" id="s1548" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;I HAVE been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1548,s1549" id="s1618" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">her uncle</mention> as they drove from the town; <quote connection="s1618" id="s1549" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.  It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His temptation is not adequate to the risk.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1619" id="s1550" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Do you really think so?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1550" id="s1619" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, brightening up for a moment.

<quote connection="s1620" id="s1551" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;Upon my word,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1551,s1552" id="s1620" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>, <quote connection="s1620" id="s1552" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.  It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.  Can you, yourself, <mention connection="s1553,s1556,s1558" id="s1621" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1621" id="s1553" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.  But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!  But I dare not hope it.  Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1622" id="s1554" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;In the first place,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1554,s1555,s1557,s1559" id="s1622" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">Mr. Gardiner</mention>, <quote connection="s1622" id="s1555" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1621" id="s1556" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1622" id="s1557" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;Well, then -- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there, though, for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1621" id="s1558" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must their marriage be private?  Oh!  no, no, this is not likely.  His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford it.  And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him, for her sake, forgo every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?  As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do in such a matter.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1622" id="s1559" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1623" id="s1560" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1560,s1561,s1564" id="s1623" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, with tears in her eyes, <quote connection="s1623" id="s1561" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I know not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.  Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.  She has been doing every thing in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater -- what shall I call it? -- susceptibility to her feelings, which are naturally lively enough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1624" id="s1562" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But you see that Jane,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1562,s1563" id="s1624" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">her aunt</mention>, <quote connection="s1624" id="s1563" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;does not think so ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1623" id="s1564" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.  That he has neither integrity nor honour.  That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1625" id="s1565" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;And do you really know all this?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1565,s1568,s1570" id="s1625" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">Mrs. Gardiner</mention>, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

<quote connection="s1626" id="s1566" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do, indeed,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1566,s1567,s1569,s1571" id="s1626" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, colouring.  <quote connection="s1626" id="s1567" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.  He must know that she was amiable and unpretending as we have found her.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1625" id="s1568" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;But does Lydia know nothing of this?  Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1626" id="s1569" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, yes! -- that, that is the worst of all.  Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.  That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1625" id="s1570" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1626" id="s1571" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites.&quot;</quote>                              ____

It may be easily believed that, however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.

<mention connection="s1574,s1576,s1578" id="s1628" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.

<quote connection="s1627" id="s1572" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Not yet,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1572,s1573,s1575,s1577,s1579" id="s1627" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>.  <quote connection="s1627" id="s1573" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1628" id="s1574" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Is my father in town?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1627" id="s1575" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1628" id="s1576" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And have you heard from him often?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1627" id="s1577" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;We have heard only once.  He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1628" id="s1578" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And my mother -- How is she?  How are you all?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1627" id="s1579" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.  She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.  Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven!  are quite well.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1629" id="s1580" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But you -- How are you?&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1580,s1581" id="s1629" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s1629" id="s1581" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You look pale. How much you must have gone through!&quot;</quote>

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.

<quote connection="s1630" id="s1582" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;If I had been able,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1582,s1583" id="s1630" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1630" id="s1583" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.  I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!  And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.&quot;</quote>

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

<quote connection="s1631" id="s1584" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;Do not give way to useless alarm,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1584,s1585" id="s1631" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">he</mention>; <quote connection="s1631" id="s1585" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.  In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1632" id="s1586" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear brother,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1586,s1587" id="s1632" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s1632" id="s1587" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;that is exactly what I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.  And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them, after they are married.  And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.  Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, -- that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.  And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know you will contrive it all.&quot;</quote>

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty.

As for <mention connection="s1588" id="s1633" speaker="Mary_Bennet">Mary</mention>, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, <quote connection="s1633" id="s1588" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.&quot;</quote>

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, <mention connection="s1589" id="s1634" speaker="Mary_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1634" id="s1589" speaker="Mary_Bennet">&quot;Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, -- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and <mention connection="s1591,s1593,s1595,s1597,s1599" id="s1637" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention> could not assert to be wholly impossible, <mention connection="s1590,s1592,s1594,s1596,s1598,s1600,s1603" id="s1636" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">the former</mention> continued the subject by saying, <quote connection="s1636" id="s1590" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But tell me all and every thing about it which I have not already heard.  Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?  They must have seen them together for ever.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1637" id="s1591" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.  I am so grieved for him.  His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.  He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland; when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1636" id="s1592" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?  Did he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1637" id="s1593" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1636" id="s1594" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1637" id="s1595" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!  I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other many weeks.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1636" id="s1596" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But not before they went to Brighton?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1637" id="s1597" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;No, I believe not.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1636" id="s1598" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?  Does he know his real character?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1637" id="s1599" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1636" id="s1600" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1639" id="s1601" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Perhaps it would have been better,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1601,s1602,s1604" id="s1639" speaker="Jane_Bennet">her sister</mention>. <quote connection="s1639" id="s1602" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1636" id="s1603" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1639" id="s1604" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;He brought it with him for us to see.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1608" id="s1644" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.

These were the contents: <quote connection="s1642" id="s1605" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;MY DEAR HARRIET,

You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham.  What a good joke it will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will drink to our good journey.

Your affectionate friend,

<mention connection="s1605" id="s1642" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">LYDIA BENNET</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1643" id="s1606" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1606,s1607" id="s1643" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> when she had finished it.  <quote connection="s1643" id="s1607" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.  But at least it shews that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.  Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father!  how he must have felt it!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1644" id="s1608" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1645" id="s1609" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  <mention connection="s1611,s1613" id="s1646" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1609,s1610,s1612" id="s1645" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1645" id="s1610" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1646" id="s1611" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I do not know. -- I hope there was. -- But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1645" id="s1612" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do not look well.  Oh!  that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1646" id="s1613" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.  Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1647" id="s1614" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;She had better have stayed at home,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1614,s1615" id="s1647" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1647" id="s1615" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;perhaps she _meant_ well, but under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.  Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.&quot;</quote>

She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

<quote connection="s1648" id="s1616" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;He meant, I believe,&quot;</quote> replied<mention connection="s1616,s1617" id="s1648" speaker="Jane_Bennet"> Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1648" id="s1617" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.  His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.  If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER VI (48)

THE whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.  Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. <mention connection="s1649" id="s1683" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">He </mention>added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.

There was also a postscript to this effect: <quote connection="s1683" id="s1649" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide us.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.

She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter -- from <mention connection="s1650" id="s1682" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.

It was as follows: <quote connection="s1682" id="s1650" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;MY DEAR SIR,

I feel myself called upon by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.  The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.  And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age.  Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.  And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.

I am, dear Sir, &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.  His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.  There was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.  Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.  <quote connection="s1681" id="s1651" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;A gamester!&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1651,s1652" id="s1681" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she </mention>cried.  <quote connection="s1681" id="s1652" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;This is wholly unexpected.  I had not an idea of it.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.  Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.

<quote connection="s1680" id="s1653" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1653,s1654" id="s1680" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she </mention>cried. <quote connection="s1680" id="s1654" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?&quot;</quote>

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, <mention connection="s1655,s1657,s1659" id="s1677" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he </mention>replied, <quote connection="s1677" id="s1655" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Say nothing of that.  Who would suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1676" id="s1656" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You must not be too severe upon yourself,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1656" id="s1676" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.

<quote connection="s1677" id="s1657" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is so prone to fall into it!  No, <mention connection="s1658" id="s1678" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1678" id="s1658" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Do you suppose them to be in London?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1677" id="s1659" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1675" id="s1660" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;And Lydia used to want to go to London,&quot;</quote> added <mention connection="s1660" id="s1675" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention>.

<quote connection="s1673" id="s1661" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;She is happy, then,&quot;</quote> said<mention connection="s1661,s1662" id="s1673" speaker="Mr_Bennet"> her father</mention>, drily; <quote connection="s1673" id="s1662" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;and her residence there will probably be of some duration.&quot;</quote>

Then, after a short silence, <mention connection="s1663" id="s1674" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he </mention>continued, <quote connection="s1674" id="s1663" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind.&quot;</quote>

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.

<quote connection="s1672" id="s1664" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;This is a parade,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1664,s1665" id="s1672" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, <quote connection="s1672" id="s1665" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can, -- or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1671" id="s1666" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;I am not going to run away, <mention connection="s1668" id="s1684" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Papa</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1666,s1667" id="s1671" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention>, fretfully; <quote connection="s1671" id="s1667" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1684" id="s1668" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;_You_ go to Brighton! -- I would not trust you so near it as East-Bourne, for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.&quot;</quote>

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

<quote connection="s1679" id="s1669" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Well, well,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1669,s1670" id="s1679" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, <quote connection="s1679" id="s1670" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;do not make yourself unhappy.  If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER VII (49)

TWO days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her <mention connection="s1685" id="s1747" speaker="Mrs_Hill">she </mention>said to Miss Bennet, <quote connection="s1747" id="s1685" speaker="Mrs_Hill">&quot;I beg your pardon, <mention connection="s1686" id="s1748" speaker="Jane_Bennet">madam</mention>, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1748" id="s1686" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1749" id="s1687" speaker="Mrs_Hill">&quot;Dear madam,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1687,s1688" id="s1749" speaker="Mrs_Hill">Mrs. Hill</mention>, in great astonishment, <quote connection="s1749" id="s1688" speaker="Mrs_Hill">&quot;don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter.&quot;</quote>

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.

They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library; -- their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by<mention connection="s1689" id="s1750" speaker="The_Butler"> the butler</mention>, who said, <quote connection="s1750" id="s1689" speaker="The_Butler">&quot;If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse.&quot;</quote>

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running, as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while <mention connection="s1690,s1692" id="s1778" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her sister</mention>, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, <quote connection="s1778" id="s1690" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, <mention connection="s1691" id="s1752" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Papa</mention>, what news?  what news?  Have you heard from my uncle?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1752" id="s1691" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1778" id="s1692" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Well, and what news does it bring?  good or bad?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1753" id="s1693" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;What is there of good to be expected?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1693,s1694" id="s1753" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, taking the letter from his pocket; <quote connection="s1753" id="s1694" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;but perhaps you would like to read it.&quot;</quote>  Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came up.

<quote connection="s1754" id="s1695" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Read it aloud,&quot;</quote> said<mention connection="s1695,s1696" id="s1754" speaker="Mr_Bennet"> their father</mention>, <quote connection="s1754" id="s1696" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;for I hardly know myself what it is about.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1756" id="s1697" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;Gracechurch-street, Monday, August 2.

MY DEAR BROTHER,

At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I reserve till we meet.  It is enough to know they are discovered; I have seen them both --&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1755" id="s1698" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Then it is as I always hoped,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1698,s1699" id="s1755" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>; <quote connection="s1755" id="s1699" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;they are married!&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth read on: <quote connection="s1756" id="s1700" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is required of you is to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.  These are conditions which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in that respect; and, I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.  There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.  Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on.  Your's, &amp;c.

<mention connection="s1700,s1697" id="s1756" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">EDW. GARDINER</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1757" id="s1701" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Is it possible!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1701,s1702" id="s1757" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, when she had finished. -- <quote connection="s1757" id="s1702" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Can it be possible that he will marry her?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1758" id="s1703" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him!&quot;</quote>  said<mention connection="s1703,s1704" id="s1758" speaker="Jane_Bennet"> her sister</mention>.  <quote connection="s1758" id="s1704" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s1706" id="s1760" speaker="Mr_Bennet">My dear father,</mention> I congratulate you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1759" id="s1705" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And have you answered the letter?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1705" id="s1759" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.

<quote connection="s1760" id="s1706" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;No; but it must be done soon.&quot;</quote>

Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.

<quote connection="s1761" id="s1707" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear father,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1707,s1708" id="s1761" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>cried, <quote connection="s1761" id="s1708" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;come back, and write immediately.  Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1762" id="s1709" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Let me write for you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1709,s1710" id="s1762" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1762" id="s1710" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;if you dislike the trouble yourself.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1763" id="s1711" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I dislike it very much,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1711,s1712,s1715" id="s1763" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he </mention>replied; <quote connection="s1763" id="s1712" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;but it must be done.&quot;</quote>

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

<quote connection="s1764" id="s1713" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And may I ask -- ?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1713,s1714,s1716" id="s1764" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1764" id="s1714" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1763" id="s1715" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1764" id="s1716" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And they must marry!  Yet he is such a man!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1779" id="s1717" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know: -- one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1765" id="s1718" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Money!  my uncle!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1718,s1719" id="s1765" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1765" id="s1719" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;what do you mean, <mention connection="s1717,s1720" id="s1779" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Sir</mention>?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1779" id="s1720" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I mean that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1766" id="s1721" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is very true,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1721,s1722,s1725" id="s1766" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1766" id="s1722" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;though it had not occurred to me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!  Oh!  it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man; I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1767" id="s1723" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;No,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1723,s1724" id="s1767" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her father</mention>, <quote connection="s1767" id="s1724" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1766" id="s1725" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a sum to be repaid?&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

<quote connection="s1768" id="s1726" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And they are really to be married!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1726,s1727" id="s1768" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, as soon as they were by themselves.  <quote connection="s1768" id="s1727" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How strange this is!  And for _this_ we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!  Oh, Lydia!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1769" id="s1728" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I comfort myself with thinking,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1728,s1729" id="s1769" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1769" id="s1729" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.  Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may have more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1770" id="s1730" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1730,s1731" id="s1770" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1770" id="s1731" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is actually with them!  If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1771" id="s1732" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1732,s1733" id="s1771" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>.  <quote connection="s1771" id="s1733" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1772" id="s1734" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Their conduct has been such,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1734,s1735" id="s1772" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s1772" id="s1735" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of it.&quot;</quote>

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood, perfectly ignorant of what had happened. <mention connection="s1737" id="s1780" speaker="Elizabeth_and_Jane">They</mention> went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.

<mention connection="s1736,s1738" id="s1773" speaker="Mr_Bennet">He </mention>was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, <quote connection="s1773" id="s1736" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Just as you please.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1780" id="s1737" speaker="Elizabeth_and_Jane">&quot;May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1773" id="s1738" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Take whatever you like, and get away.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

<quote connection="s1774" id="s1739" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dear, dear Lydia!&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1739,s1740" id="s1774" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she </mention>cried: <quote connection="s1774" id="s1740" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;This is delightful indeed! -- She will be married! -- I shall see her again! -- She will be married at sixteen! -- My good, kind brother! -- I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage every thing. How I long to see her!  and to see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!  I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia! -- How merry we shall be together when we meet!&quot;</quote>

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

<quote connection="s1776" id="s1741" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;For we must attribute this happy conclusion,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1741,s1742" id="s1776" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she </mention>added, <quote connection="s1776" id="s1742" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;in a great measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1775" id="s1743" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s1743,s1744" id="s1775" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s1775" id="s1744" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.  Well!  I am so happy.  In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds.  And she was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.  We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.&quot;</quote>

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted.  One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.

<quote connection="s1777" id="s1745" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I will go to Meryton,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1745,s1746" id="s1777" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1777" id="s1746" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Phillips.  And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down and order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.  Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?  Oh!  here comes Hill.  My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.

__CHAPTER VIII (50)

MR. BENNET had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.  Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.  This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.  This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.  He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.

The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant farm house.  But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.  <mention connection="s1781" id="s1789" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">She </mention>was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a <quote connection="s1789" id="s1781" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;proper situation&quot;</quote> for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.

<quote connection="s1790" id="s1782" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Haye-Park might do,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1782,s1783" id="s1790" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1790" id="s1783" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.&quot;</quote>

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, <mention connection="s1784" id="s1791" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he </mention>said to her, <quote connection="s1791" id="s1784" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.  Into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at Longbourn.&quot;</quote>

A long dispute followed this declaration, but Mr. Bennet was firm; it soon led to another, and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.  Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.  Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.  She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.  But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.  It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.  But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.  But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.                              ____

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family, and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.

<quote connection="s1792" id="s1785" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;It was greatly my wish that he should do so,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1785" id="s1792" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">he </mention>added, <quote connection="s1793" id="s1786" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">&quot;as soon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.  It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and, I hope, among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.  And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.  He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South.  She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. -- Your's, &amp;c.

<mention connection="s1786" id="s1793" speaker="Mr_Gardiner">E. GARDINER</mention>.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company -- for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire -- was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.

<quote connection="" id="s1787" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,&quot;</quote> said she, <quote connection="" id="s1788" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;it will be quite shocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment.&quot;</quote>

His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme; and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.

__CHAPTER IX (51)

THEIR sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.

They came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.

Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.  _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.

<quote connection="s1824" id="s1794" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Only think of its being three months,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1794,s1795" id="s1824" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she </mention>cried, <quote connection="s1824" id="s1795" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.&quot;</quote>

Her father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but <mention connection="s1796" id="s1825" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she</mention>, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, <quote connection="s1825" id="s1796" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear <mention connection="s1797" id="s1826" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">her </mention>say to her eldest sister, <quote connection="s1826" id="s1797" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.&quot;</quote>

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called <quote connection="" id="s1798" speaker="NOTANUTTERANCE">&quot;Mrs. Wickham&quot;</quote> by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

<quote connection="s1827" id="s1799" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Well, <mention connection="s1801" id="s1828" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">mamma</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1799,s1800,s1802,s1804" id="s1827" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she</mention>, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, <quote connection="s1827" id="s1800" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;and what do you think of my husband?  Is not he a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to Brighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1828" id="s1801" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.  Must it be so?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1827" id="s1802" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it of all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1829" id="s1803" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I should like it beyond any thing!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1803" id="s1829" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>.

<quote connection="s1827" id="s1804" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1830" id="s1805" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I thank you for my share of the favour,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1805,s1806" id="s1830" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1830" id="s1806" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.&quot;</quote>

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.

Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.  She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, <mention connection="s1807,s1810,s1811,s1813" id="s1831" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">she </mention>said to Elizabeth, <quote connection="s1831" id="s1807" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.  You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.  Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1832" id="s1808" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;No really,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1808,s1809" id="s1832" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1832" id="s1809" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1831" id="s1810" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.  We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!  I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1831" id="s1811" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.  If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out.  However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1833" id="s1812" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Darcy!&quot;</quote> repeated <mention connection="s1812" id="s1833" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, in utter amazement.

<quote connection="s1831" id="s1813" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But gracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word about it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham say?  It was to be such a secret!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1834" id="s1814" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;If it was to be secret,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1814,s1815" id="s1834" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>, <quote connection="s1834" id="s1815" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;say not another word on the subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1835" id="s1816" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  certainly,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1816,s1817" id="s1835" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, though burning with curiosity; <quote connection="s1835" id="s1817" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;we will ask you no questions.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1836" id="s1818" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Thank you,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1818,s1819" id="s1836" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>, <quote connection="s1836" id="s1819" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.&quot;</quote>

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.

<quote connection="s1837" id="s1820" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You may readily comprehend,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1820,s1821" id="s1837" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>added, <quote connection="s1837" id="s1821" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let me understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1838" id="s1822" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Not that I _shall_, though,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1822,s1823" id="s1838" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>added to herself, as she finished the letter; <quote connection="s1838" id="s1823" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.&quot;</quote>

Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

__CHAPTER X (52)

ELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.

<quote connection="s1870" id="s1839" speaker="Mrs_Gardiner">&quot;Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.

MY DEAR NIECE,

I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.  Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.  If he _had_ _another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.  She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in ---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.  It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.  He has been accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another_ _interest_ in the affair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.  Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly ever mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been wanting me this half hour.  Your's, very sincerely,

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her -- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be sure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.  She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.

<mention connection="s1847,s1849" id="s1873" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She </mention>replied in the affirmative.

<quote connection="s1871" id="s1846" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.

<quote connection="s1873" id="s1847" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, she did.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1871" id="s1848" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;And what did she say?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1873" id="s1849" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had -- not turned out well.  At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but <mention connection="s1851,s1854,s1856,s1858,s1860,s1862,s1866,s1864,s1868" id="s1875" speaker="Mr_Wickham">he </mention>soon afterwards said, <quote connection="s1875" id="s1851" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1854" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1855" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes; he introduced us to his sister.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1856" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;And do you like her?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1857" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Very much.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1858" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very promising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn out well.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1859" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1860" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Did you go by the village of Kympton?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1861" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not recollect that we did.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1862" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1863" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How should you have liked making sermons?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1864" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought not to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1865" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as_ _good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1866" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;You have.  Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1876" id="s1867" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1875" id="s1868" speaker="Mr_Wickham">&quot;You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.&quot;</quote>

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, <mention connection="s1869" id="s1877" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, <quote connection="s1877" id="s1869" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.  Do not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.&quot;</quote>

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

__CHAPTER XI (53)

MR. WICKHAM was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.

<quote connection="s1927" id="s1878" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear <mention connection="s1880" id="s1928" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention>,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1879,s1878,s1881" id="s1927" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she </mention>cried, <quote connection="s1927" id="s1879" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;when shall we meet again?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1928" id="s1880" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;Oh, lord!  I don't know.  Not these two or three years, perhaps.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1927" id="s1881" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Write to me very often, <mention connection="s1882" id="s1929" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">my dear</mention>.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1929" id="s1882" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much time for writing.  My sisters may write to _me_.  They will have nothing else to do.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

<quote connection="s1930" id="s1883" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;He is as fine a fellow,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1883,s1884" id="s1930" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention>, as soon as they were out of the house, <quote connection="s1930" id="s1884" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.&quot;</quote>

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

<quote connection="s1931" id="s1885" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I often think,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1885,s1886" id="s1931" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1931" id="s1886" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.  One seems so forlorn without them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1932" id="s1887" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;This is the consequence, you see, <mention connection="s1889" id="s1933" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Madam</mention>, of marrying a daughter,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1887,s1888" id="s1932" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s1932" id="s1888" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1933" id="s1889" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.&quot;</quote>

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  <mention connection="s1890,s1891" id="s1934" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">She </mention>looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.

<quote connection="s1934" id="s1890" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,&quot;</quote> (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  <quote connection="s1934" id="s1891" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well, so much the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what _may_ happen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so, is it quite certain he is coming?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1935" id="s1892" speaker="Mrs_Phillips">&quot;You may depend on it,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1892,s1893" id="s1935" speaker="Mrs_Phillips">the other</mention>, <quote connection="s1935" id="s1893" speaker="Mrs_Phillips">&quot;for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.

It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, <mention connection="s1894" id="s1936" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she </mention>said, <quote connection="s1936" id="s1894" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.

<quote connection="s1937" id="s1895" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yet it is hard,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1895,s1896" id="s1937" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>sometimes thought, <quote connection="s1937" id="s1896" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!  I _will_ leave him to himself.&quot;</quote>

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

<quote connection="s1938" id="s1897" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, <mention connection="s1899" id="s1939" speaker="Mr_Bennet">my dear</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1897,s1898" id="s1938" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s1938" id="s1898" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;you will wait on him of course.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1939" id="s1899" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1902" id="s1954" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">His wife</mention> represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

<quote connection="s1940" id="s1900" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;'Tis an etiquette I despise,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1900,s1901" id="s1940" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>.  <quote connection="s1940" id="s1901" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;If he wants our society, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1954" id="s1902" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.  But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.&quot;</quote>

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before _they_ did.

As the day of his arrival drew near, <quote connection="s1941" id="s1903" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1903,s1904" id="s1941" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane </mention>to her sister.  <quote connection="s1941" id="s1904" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1942" id="s1905" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1905,s1906" id="s1942" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>; <quote connection="s1942" id="s1906" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.  But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.

<quote connection="s1943" id="s1907" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;There is a gentleman with him, <mention connection="s1909,s1912" id="s1944" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">mamma</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1907,s1908" id="s1943" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention>; <quote connection="s1943" id="s1908" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;who can it be?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1944" id="s1909" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1945" id="s1910" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;La!&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s1910,s1911" id="s1945" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention>, <quote connection="s1945" id="s1911" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.  Mr. what's-his-name.  That tall, proud man.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1944" id="s1912" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.&quot;</quote>

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she would not be secure.

<quote connection="s1946" id="s1913" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Let me first see how he behaves,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1913,s1914" id="s1946" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>; <quote connection="s1946" id="s1914" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;it will then be early enough for expectation.&quot;</quote>

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.

Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.

<quote connection="s1947" id="s1915" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Could I expect it to be otherwise!&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1915,s1916" id="s1947" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>.  <quote connection="s1947" id="s1916" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yet why did he come?&quot;</quote>

She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.

She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.

<quote connection="s1948" id="s1917" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1917,s1918" id="s1948" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>.

He readily agreed to it.

<quote connection="s1948" id="s1918" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I began to be afraid you would never come back again.  People _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas is married and settled.  And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.  It was in the _Times_ and the _Courier_, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only said, &quot;Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,&quot; without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.  Did you see it?&quot;</quote>

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.

<quote connection="s1949" id="s1919" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,&quot;</quote> continued <mention connection="s1919,s1920" id="s1949" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s1949" id="s1920" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven!  he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.  It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

<quote connection="s1950" id="s1921" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1921,s1922" id="s1950" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s1950" id="s1922" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor.  I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.

<quote connection="s1951" id="s1923" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;The first wish of my heart,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1923,s1924" id="s1951" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>to herself, <quote connection="s1951" id="s1924" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;is never more to be in company with either of them.  Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!  Let me never see either one or the other again!&quot;</quote>

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.

<quote connection="s1952" id="s1925" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s1925,s1926" id="s1952" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s1952" id="s1926" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.&quot;</quote>

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.

__CHAPTER XII (54)

AS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

<quote connection="s1983" id="s1955" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1955,s1956" id="s1983" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1983" id="s1956" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;did he come at all?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1957" id="s1994" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

<quote connection="s1994" id="s1957" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me, why come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.&quot;</quote>

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

<quote connection="s1984" id="s1958" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Now,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1958,s1959,s1962" id="s1984" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1984" id="s1959" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1985" id="s1960" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, very indifferent indeed,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1961,s1960" id="s1985" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, laughingly. <quote connection="s1985" id="s1961" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, Jane, take care.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1984" id="s1962" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My dear <mention connection="s1963" id="s1986" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1986" id="s1963" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.&quot;</quote>                              ____

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.  Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

<quote connection="s1987" id="s1964" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If he does not come to me, _then_,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1964,s1965" id="s1987" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s1987" id="s1965" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I shall give him up for ever.&quot;</quote>

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair.

And on the gentlemen's approaching, <mention connection="s1966" id="s1995" speaker="one_of_the_girls">one of the girls</mention> moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, <quote connection="s1995" id="s1966" speaker="one_of_the_girls">&quot;The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.  We want none of them; do we?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s1969,s1971" id="s1993" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy </mention>had walked away to another part of the room.  <mention connection="s1967" id="s1989" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She </mention>followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!

<quote connection="s1989" id="s1967" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!&quot;</quote>

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and <mention connection="s1968,s1970" id="s1988" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>seized the opportunity of saying, <quote connection="s1988" id="s1968" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Is your sister at Pemberley still?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1993" id="s1969" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1988" id="s1970" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1993" id="s1971" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.&quot;</quote>

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She now lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

<quote connection="s1990" id="s1972" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Well girls,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1972,s1973" id="s1990" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, as soon as they were left to themselves, <quote connection="s1990" id="s1973" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;What say you to the day?  I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides? &quot;Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.&quot; She did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.&quot;</quote>

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

<quote connection="s1991" id="s1974" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;It has been a very agreeable day,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1974,s1975,s1976,s1979,s1981" id="s1991" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention> to Elizabeth.  <quote connection="s1991" id="s1975" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth smiled.

<quote connection="s1991" id="s1976" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It mortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1992" id="s1977" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You are very cruel,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1977,s1978,s1980,s1982" id="s1992" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her sister</mention>, <quote connection="s1992" id="s1978" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1991" id="s1979" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;How hard it is in some cases to be believed!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1992" id="s1980" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And how impossible in others!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1991" id="s1981" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s1992" id="s1982" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER XIII (55)

A FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

<quote connection="s2036" id="s1996" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Next time you call,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s1996,s1997,s1998" id="s2036" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s2036" id="s1997" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I hope we shall be more lucky.&quot;</quote>

He should be particularly happy at any time, &amp;c. &amp;amp;c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

<quote connection="s2036" id="s1998" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Can you come to-morrow?&quot;</quote>

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed.

In ran <mention connection="s1999,s2002" id="s2037" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, <quote connection="s2037" id="s1999" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2038" id="s2000" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;We will be down as soon as we can,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2000,s2001" id="s2038" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>; <quote connection="s2038" id="s2001" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2037" id="s2002" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick, be quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?&quot;</quote>

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.  Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last <mention connection="s2003" id="s2039" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">Kitty</mention> did, she very innocently said, <quote connection="s2039" id="s2003" speaker="Kitty_Bennet">&quot;What is the matter <mention connection="s2004" id="s2040" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">mamma</mention>?  What do you keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2040" id="s2004" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.&quot;</quote> She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, <mention connection="s2005" id="s2041" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, <quote connection="s2041" id="s2005" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,&quot;</quote> took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give in to it.

In a few minutes, <mention connection="s2006" id="s2042" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> half-opened the door and called out, <quote connection="s2042" id="s2006" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was forced to go.

<quote connection="s2043" id="s2007" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;We may as well leave them by themselves you know;&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2007,s2008" id="s2043" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, as soon as she was in the hall.  <quote connection="s2043" id="s2008" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing room.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing room.

Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.  Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.

But on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all.  _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.  Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

<quote connection="s2044" id="s2009" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;'Tis too much!&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2009,s2010" id="s2044" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s2044" id="s2010" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;by far too much.  I do not deserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.

<quote connection="s2045" id="s2011" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I must go instantly to my mother;&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2011,s2012" id="s2045" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention> cried.  <quote connection="s2045" id="s2012" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my father already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I bear so much happiness!&quot;</quote>

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.

<quote connection="s2046" id="s2013" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And this,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2013,s2014" id="s2046" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s2046" id="s2014" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!  of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!  the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!&quot;</quote>

In a few minutes <mention connection="s2016" id="s2048" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.

<quote connection="s2047" id="s2015" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Where is your sister?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2015" id="s2047" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention> hastily, as he opened the door.

<quote connection="s2048" id="s2016" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment, I dare say.&quot;</quote>

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, <mention connection="s2017" id="s2049" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention> turned to his daughter, and said, <quote connection="s2049" id="s2017" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2020" id="s2051" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.

<quote connection="s2050" id="s2018" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You are a good girl;&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2018,s2019" id="s2050" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s2050" id="s2019" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means unlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2051" id="s2020" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2052" id="s2021" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s2021,s2022,s2023" id="s2052" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">his wife</mention>, <quote connection="s2052" id="s2022" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.&quot;</quote>  Then addressing her daughter, <quote connection="s2052" id="s2023" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!&quot;</quote>

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared for no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.

<quote connection="s2053" id="s2024" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;He has made me so happy,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2024,s2025,s2028,s2031" id="s2053" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>, one evening, <quote connection="s2053" id="s2025" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!  I had not believed it possible.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s2026" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I suspected as much,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="" id="s2054" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="" id="s2027" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But how did he account for it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2053" id="s2028" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;It must have been his sister's doing.  They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2055" id="s2029" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is the most unforgiving speech,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2030,s2029" id="s2055" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s2055" id="s2030" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;that I ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2053" id="s2031" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Would you believe it, <mention connection="s2032" id="s2058" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2058" id="s2032" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.&quot;</quote>

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.

<quote connection="s2056" id="s2033" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!&quot;</quote>  cried <mention connection="s2034,s2033" id="s2056" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>.  <quote connection="s2056" id="s2034" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  <mention connection="s2035" id="s2057" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!  If I could but see _you_ as happy!  If there _were_ but such another man for you!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2057" id="s2035" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.&quot;</quote>

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

__CHAPTER XIV (56)

ONE morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.  It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.

After sitting for a moment in silence, <mention connection="s2059" id="s2126" speaker="Lady_Catherine">she</mention> said very stiffly to Elizabeth, <quote connection="s2126" id="s2059" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose, is your mother.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

<quote connection="s2129" id="s2060" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;And that I suppose is one of your sisters.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2127" id="s2061" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Yes, <mention connection="s2060" id="s2129" speaker="Lady_Catherine">madam</mention>,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2061,s2062,s2064" id="s2127" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.  <quote connection="s2127" id="s2062" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2128" id="s2063" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;You have a very small park here,&quot;</quote> returned <mention connection="s2063" id="s2128" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> after a short silence.

<quote connection="s2127" id="s2064" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, <mention connection="s2065" id="s2130" speaker="Lady_Catherine">my lady</mention>, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2130" id="s2065" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2066" id="s2131" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added, <quote connection="s2131" id="s2066" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;May I take the liberty of asking <mention connection="s2067" id="s2132" speaker="Lady_Catherine">your ladyship</mention> whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2132" id="s2067" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but <mention connection="s2068" id="s2133" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth, <quote connection="s2133" id="s2068" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2134" id="s2069" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Go, my dear,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s2069,s2070" id="s2134" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">her mother</mention>, <quote connection="s2134" id="s2070" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;and shew her ladyship about the different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.

<quote connection="s2135" id="s2071" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How could I ever think her like her nephew?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2071" id="s2135" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, as she looked in her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, <mention connection="s2072" id="s2136" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> began in the following manner: --

<quote connection="s2136" id="s2072" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2073" id="s2137" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> looked with unaffected astonishment.

<quote connection="s2137" id="s2073" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2138" id="s2074" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Miss Bennet,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2074,s2075" id="s2138" speaker="Lady_Catherine">her ladyship</mention>, in an angry tone, <quote connection="s2138" id="s2075" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2139" id="s2076" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If you believed it impossible to be true,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2076,s2077" id="s2139" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, colouring with astonishment and disdain, <quote connection="s2139" id="s2077" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.  What could <mention connection="s2078,s2081" id="s2162" speaker="Lady_Catherine">your ladyship</mention> propose by it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2162" id="s2078" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2140" id="s2079" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2079,s2080,s2082" id="s2140" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> coolly, <quote connection="s2140" id="s2080" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2162" id="s2081" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2140" id="s2082" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I never heard that it was.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2141" id="s2083" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2142" id="s2084" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with <mention connection="s2083" id="s2141" speaker="Lady_Catherine">your ladyship</mention>.  _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2143" id="s2085" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;This is not to be borne.  <mention connection="s2084" id="s2142" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>, I insist on being satisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s2086" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s2085,s2087,s2089,s2091" id="s2143" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Your ladyship</mention> has declared it to be impossible.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2143" id="s2087" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.  But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2144" id="s2088" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2143" id="s2089" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;<mention connection="s2088,s2090,s2092" id="s2144" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed to such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2144" id="s2090" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2143" id="s2091" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my_ _daughter_.  Now what have you to say?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2144" id="s2092" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2093,s2095" id="s2145" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> hesitated for a moment, and then replied, <quote connection="s2145" id="s2093" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.  While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?  To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2146" id="s2094" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended on others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2145" id="s2095" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, <mention connection="s2094" id="s2146" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2147" id="s2096" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;These are heavy misfortunes,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2096,s2097" id="s2147" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s2147" id="s2097" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2149" id="s2098" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is nothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to understand, <mention connection="s2099,s2101" id="s2148" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Miss Bennet</mention>, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.  I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2148" id="s2099" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;_That_ will make <mention connection="s2098,s2100,s2102" id="s2149" speaker="Lady_Catherine">your ladyship</mention>'s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2149" id="s2100" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though untitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it must not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2148" id="s2101" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2149" id="s2102" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;True.  You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.  But who was your mother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2150" id="s2103" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Whatever my connections may be,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2103,s2104" id="s2150" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s2150" id="s2104" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2163" id="s2105" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?&quot;</quote>

Though <mention connection="s2106" id="s2151" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth </mention>would not, for the mere purpose of obliging <mention connection="s2105" id="s2163" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention>, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation, <quote connection="s2151" id="s2106" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am not.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2107" id="s2152" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> seemed pleased.

<quote connection="s2152" id="s2107" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2153" id="s2108" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I will make no promise of the kind.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2154" id="s2109" speaker="Lady_Catherine"><mention connection="s2108,s2110" id="s2153" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Miss Bennet</mention> I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2153" id="s2110" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?  Allow me to say, <mention connection="s2109,s2111" id="s2154" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention>, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.  How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2154" id="s2111" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.  To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.  I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.  And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?

<quote connection="s2155" id="s2112" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2112,s2113" id="s2155" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she </mention>resentfully answered.  <quote connection="s2155" id="s2113" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.&quot;</quote>

And she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.  <mention connection="s2114" id="s2156" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Her ladyship</mention> was highly incensed.

<quote connection="s2156" id="s2114" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!  <mention connection="s2115,s2117" id="s2165" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Unfeeling, selfish girl</mention>!

<quote connection="s2165" id="s2115" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s2116,s2118" id="s2157" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention>, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my sentiments.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2157" id="s2116" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;You are then resolved to have him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2165" id="s2117" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2157" id="s2118" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2158" id="s2119" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2119,s2120" id="s2158" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s2158" id="s2120" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2164" id="s2121" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve! Very well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to try you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.&quot;</quote>

In this manner <mention connection="s2121" id="s2164" speaker="Lady_Catherine">Lady Catherine</mention> talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, <mention connection="s2122" id="s2159" speaker="Lady_Catherine">she </mention>added, <quote connection="s2159" id="s2122" speaker="Lady_Catherine">&quot;I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to your mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most seriously displeased.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.  <mention connection="s2125" id="s2161" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Her mother</mention> impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

<quote connection="s2160" id="s2123" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;She did not choose it,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2123,s2124" id="s2160" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">her daughter</mention>, <quote connection="s2160" id="s2124" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;she would go.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2161" id="s2125" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was prodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

__CHAPTER XV (57)

THE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was a rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that case he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

<quote connection="s2189" id="s2166" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2166,s2167" id="s2189" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> added, <quote connection="s2189" id="s2167" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I shall know how to understand it.  I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.&quot;</quote>                              ____

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

<quote connection="s2190" id="s2168" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2168,s2169" id="s2190" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, <quote connection="s2190" id="s2169" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I was going to look for you; come into my room.&quot;</quote>

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.

<mention connection="s2170" id="s2191" speaker="Mr_Bennet">He</mention> then said, <quote connection="s2191" id="s2170" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.  I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.&quot;</quote>

The colour now rushed into <mention connection="s2172" id="s2197" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>'s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when <mention connection="s2171,s2195,s2175,s2177,s2179,s2180,s2188" id="s2192" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her father</mention> continued, <quote connection="s2192" id="s2171" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of _your_ admirer.  This letter is from Mr. Collins.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2197" id="s2172" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;From <mention connection="s2174,s2176,s2178,s2182,s2184" id="s2196" speaker="Mr_Collins">Mr. Collins</mention>!  and what can _he_ have to say?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2192" id="s2195" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What relates to yourself, is as follows.&quot;</quote>  <quote connection="s2196" id="s2174" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2192" id="s2175" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?&quot;</quote> <quote connection="s2196" id="s2176" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2192" id="s2177" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it comes out.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2196" id="s2178" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2192" id="s2179" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;_Mr._ _Darcy_, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life!  It is admirable!&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2181" id="s2194" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention> tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.

<quote connection="s2192" id="s2180" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Are you not diverted?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2194" id="s2181" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2196" id="s2182" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&quot;</quote>  <quote connection="" id="s2183" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Collins moreover adds,&quot;</quote> <quote connection="s2196" id="s2184" speaker="Mr_Collins">&quot;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.&quot;</quote>  <quote connection="" id="s2185" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;_That_ is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2193" id="s2186" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s2186,s2187" id="s2193" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s2193" id="s2187" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am excessively diverted.  But it is so strange!&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2192" id="s2188" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Yes -- _that_ is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her consent?&quot;</quote>

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.  It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.  Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

__CHAPTER XVI (58)

INSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.  The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.

Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, <mention connection="s2198,s2201" id="s2244" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> immediately said, <quote connection="s2244" id="s2198" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.  I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2245" id="s2199" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2199,s2200" id="s2245" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, in a tone of surprise and emotion, <quote connection="s2245" id="s2200" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2244" id="s2201" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2246" id="s2202" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;If you _will_ thank me,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2202,s2203" id="s2246" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> replied, <quote connection="s2246" id="s2203" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;let it be for yourself alone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.  But your _family_ owe me nothing.  Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of _you_.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a short pause, <mention connection="s2204" id="s2247" speaker="Mr_Darcy">her companion</mention> added, <quote connection="s2247" id="s2204" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You are too generous to trifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.  _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

<quote connection="s2248" id="s2205" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It taught me to hope,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2205,s2206,s2208,s2211,s2213" id="s2248" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, <quote connection="s2248" id="s2206" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as <mention connection="s2207" id="s2249" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> replied, <quote connection="s2249" id="s2207" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2248" id="s2208" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without abhorrence.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2250" id="s2209" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2209,s2210,s2212,s2214" id="s2250" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.  <quote connection="s2250" id="s2210" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2248" id="s2211" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: &quot;had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.&quot;  Those were your words.  You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2250" id="s2212" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2248" id="s2213" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2250" id="s2214" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections will not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.&quot;</quote>

Darcy mentioned his letter.  <quote connection="s2251" id="s2215" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Did it,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2215,s2216" id="s2251" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, <quote connection="s2251" id="s2216" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;did it _soon_ make you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2219,s2222,s2230,s2228,s2226,s2224" id="s2254" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">She</mention> explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.

<quote connection="s2252" id="s2217" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I knew,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2217,s2218" id="s2252" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, <quote connection="s2252" id="s2218" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.  I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2254" id="s2219" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2253" id="s2220" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;When I wrote that letter,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2220,s2221,s2223,s2225,s2227,s2229" id="s2253" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s2253" id="s2221" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2254" id="s2222" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the letter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2253" id="s2223" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence.  But with _me_, it is not so.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you, I was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my reception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2254" id="s2224" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2253" id="s2225" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2254" id="s2226" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2253" id="s2227" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2254" id="s2228" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2253" id="s2229" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2254" id="s2230" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2255" id="s2231" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;My object _then_,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2231,s2232" id="s2255" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention>, <quote connection="s2255" id="s2232" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.&quot;</quote>

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.

<quote connection="" id="s2233" speaker="UNSURE">&quot;What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!&quot;</quote> was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.  <mention connection="s2235" id="s2258" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Darcy</mention> was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.

<quote connection="s2256" id="s2234" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I must ask whether you were surprised?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2234,s2236" id="s2256" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>.

<quote connection="s2258" id="s2235" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2256" id="s2236" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as much.&quot;</quote>  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.

<quote connection="s2257" id="s2237" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;On the evening before my going to London,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2237,s2238,s2241,s2243" id="s2257" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention>, <quote connection="s2257" id="s2238" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His surprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.

<quote connection="s2259" id="s2239" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Did you speak from your own observation,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2239,s2240,s2242" id="s2259" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s2259" id="s2240" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2257" id="s2241" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2259" id="s2242" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2257" id="s2243" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was angry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.  He has heartily forgiven me now.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they parted.

__CHAPTER XVII (59)

<quote connection="s2304" id="s2260" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;MY dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?&quot;</quote> was a question which Elizabeth received from <mention connection="s2260" id="s2304" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, <mention connection="s2261" id="s2305" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention> was absolutely incredulous here.

<quote connection="s2305" id="s2261" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;You are joking, <mention connection="s2262" id="s2306" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>.  This cannot be! -- engaged to Mr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it to be impossible.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2306" id="s2262" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the truth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2263" id="s2307" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention> looked at her doubtingly.  <quote connection="s2307" id="s2263" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Oh, <mention connection="s2264" id="s2308" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>!  it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2308" id="s2264" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You know nothing of the matter.  _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.

<quote connection="s2309" id="s2265" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe you,&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s2265,s2266" id="s2309" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>.  <quote connection="s2309" id="s2266" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;My dear, dear <mention connection="s2267" id="s2310" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>, I would -- I do congratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2310" id="s2267" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, <mention connection="s2268,s2270" id="s2311" speaker="Jane_Bennet">Jane</mention>?  Shall you like to have such a brother?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2311" id="s2268" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?  Oh, <mention connection="s2269,s2271" id="s2312" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Lizzy</mention>!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.  Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2312" id="s2269" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2311" id="s2270" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2312" id="s2271" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s2272" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;<mention connection="s2273" id="s2313" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">My dearest sister</mention>, now _be_ serious.  I want to talk very seriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2313" id="s2273" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.&quot;</quote>

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.

<quote connection="s2314" id="s2274" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;Now I am quite happy,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2274,s2275" id="s2314" speaker="Jane_Bennet">she</mention>, <quote connection="s2314" id="s2275" speaker="Jane_Bennet">&quot;for you will be as happy as myself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.                              ____

<quote connection="s2315" id="s2276" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Good gracious!&quot;</quote> cried <mention connection="s2276,s2277" id="s2315" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, as she stood at a window the next morning, <quote connection="s2315" id="s2277" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.  What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and <mention connection="s2278" id="s2316" speaker="Mr_Bingley">he</mention> soon afterwards said aloud, <quote connection="s2316" id="s2278" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2317" id="s2279" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2279,s2280" id="s2317" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention>, <quote connection="s2317" id="s2280" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2318" id="s2281" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;It may do very well for the others,&quot;</quote> replied <mention connection="s2281,s2282" id="s2318" speaker="Mr_Bingley">Mr. Bingley</mention>; <quote connection="s2318" id="s2282" speaker="Mr_Bingley">&quot;but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?&quot;</quote> Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.

As she went up stairs to get ready, <mention connection="s2283" id="s2319" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">Mrs. Bennet</mention> followed her, saying, <quote connection="s2319" id="s2283" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.&quot;</quote>

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.  She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.                              ____

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means -- that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.  In a few minutes <mention connection="s2284" id="s2331" speaker="Mr_Darcy">he</mention> approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, <quote connection="s2331" id="s2284" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Go to your father, he wants you in the library.&quot;</quote>  She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.  <quote connection="s2320" id="s2285" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2285,s2286" id="s2320" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, <quote connection="s2320" id="s2286" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;what are you doing?  Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always hated him?&quot;</quote>

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured <mention connection="s2287" id="s2322" speaker="Mr_Bennet">him</mention>, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

<quote connection="s2322" id="s2287" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2321" id="s2288" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Have you any other objection,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2288,s2289" id="s2321" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>, <quote connection="s2321" id="s2289" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;than your belief of my indifference?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="" id="s2290" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2323" id="s2291" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I do, I do like him,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2291,s2292" id="s2323" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> replied, with tears in her eyes, <quote connection="s2323" id="s2292" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly amiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2324" id="s2293" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Lizzy,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2293,s2294" id="s2324" speaker="Mr_Bennet">her father</mention>, <quote connection="s2324" id="s2294" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I have given him my consent.  He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise you to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

<quote connection="s2325" id="s2295" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Well, my dear,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2295,s2296" id="s2325" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>, when she ceased speaking, <quote connection="s2325" id="s2296" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I have no more to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.&quot;</quote>

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  <mention connection="s2297" id="s2326" speaker="Mr_Bennet">He</mention> heard her with astonishment.

<quote connection="s2326" id="s2297" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did every thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!  So much the better.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.  Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.&quot;</quote>

<mention connection="s2298" id="s2327" speaker="Mr_Bennet">He</mention> then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the room, <quote connection="s2327" id="s2298" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.&quot;</quote>

Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.  Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.  <mention connection="s2299" id="s2328" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">She</mention> began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

<quote connection="s2328" id="s2299" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me! Mr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true? Oh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased -- so happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! -- Oh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three daughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will become of me.  I shall go distracted.&quot;</quote>

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.

<quote connection="s2329" id="s2300" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;My dearest child,&quot;</quote> <mention connection="s2300,s2301" id="s2329" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">she</mention> cried, <quote connection="s2329" id="s2301" speaker="Mrs_Bennet">&quot;I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!  'Tis as good as a Lord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married by a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it tomorrow.&quot;</quote>

This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.

<quote connection="s2330" id="s2302" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2302,s2303" id="s2330" speaker="Mr_Bennet">he</mention>. <quote connection="s2330" id="s2303" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's.&quot;</quote>

__CHAPTER XVIII (60)

ELIZABETH'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted <mention connection="s2334,s2336,s2338,s2340,s2348,s2350,s2346,s2342,s2344" id="s2355" speaker="Mr_Darcy">Mr. Darcy</mention> to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.  <quote connection="s2354" id="s2332" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How could you begin?&quot;</quote> said <mention connection="s2332,s2333,s2335,s2337,s2339,s2341,s2343,s2345,s2347" id="s2354" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention>.  <quote connection="s2354" id="s2333" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2334" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2335" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2336" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;For the liveliness of your mind, I did.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2337" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very little less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.  Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be sure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2338" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2339" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a virtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2340" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2341" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;But I was embarrassed.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2342" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;And so was I.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2343" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2344" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;A man who had felt less, might.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2345" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.  I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.  _Too_ _much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned the subject.  This will never do.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2346" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly fair.  Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.  My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2354" id="s2347" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more serious consequence?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2348" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2357" id="s2349" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2355" id="s2350" speaker="Mr_Darcy">&quot;I am more likely to want more time than courage, <mention connection="s2351,s2349" id="s2357" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">Elizabeth</mention>. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.&quot;</quote>

<quote connection="s2357" id="s2351" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.&quot;</quote>

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, <mention connection="s2352" id="s2356" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">she</mention> was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: <quote connection="s2356" id="s2352" speaker="Elizabeth_Bennet">&quot;I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.  But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly as to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will go round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the world.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.  Your's, &amp;c.&quot;</quote>

Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what <mention connection="s2353" id="s2358" speaker="Mr_Bennet">Mr. Bennet</mention> sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.

<quote connection="s2358" id="s2353" speaker="Mr_Bennet">&quot;DEAR SIR,

I must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.  He has more to give.

Your's sincerely, &amp;c.&quot;</quote>

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.

__CHAPTER XIX (61)

HAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.  With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from <mention connection="s2359" id="s2360" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">Lydia</mention> on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.

The letter was to this effect: <quote connection="s2360" id="s2359" speaker="Lydia_Bennet">&quot;MY DEAR LlZZY,

I wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

Your's, &amp;c.&quot;</quote>

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.  His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
