    "### 3.4 Contextual Gender Analysis (`02b_context.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Principles:**\n",
    "- Use pronoun context and coreference resolution for characters with unknown gender\n",
    "- Analyze sentences containing character mentions to find gendered pronouns\n",
    "- Apply advanced NLP techniques (coreference resolution) to improve classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "- Used NLTK for sentence tokenization\n",
    "- Analyzed sentences containing character mentions for gendered pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers)\n",
    "- Used spaCy with the coreferee extension for coreference resolution\n",
    "- Applied threshold-based classification based on pronoun counts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models and Libraries:**\n",
    "- NLTK for sentence tokenization\n",
    "- spaCy `en_core_web_lg` model for linguistic analysis\n",
    "- `coreferee` extension for coreference resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Thresholds:**\n",
    "- Minimum number of dominant pronouns required: 2\n",
    "- Minimum difference between male/female pronoun counts: 1"
